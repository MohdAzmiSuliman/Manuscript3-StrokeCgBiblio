Abstract = {Background and Purpose - A large proportion of disabled stroke survivors
   live at home and are supported by informal caregivers. Identification of
   determinants of caregiver burden will help to target caregiver
   interventions.
   Methods - Data on patient, caregiver, and health and social support
   characteristics were collected prospectively over 1 year in 232 stroke
   survivors in a randomized trial of caregiver training. The contribution
   of these variables to caregiver burden score (CBS) and quality of life
   (QOL) measures at 3 months and 1 year was analyzed using regression
   models.
   Results - Stroke patients had a mean age of 74 +/- 11 years, and 120
   (52\%) were men. The mean age of caregivers was 65.7 +/- 12.5 years, 149
   (64\%) were females, and 116 (50\%) had received caregiver training. The
   mean CBS was 48 +/- 13 and 38 +/- 11 (score range of bad to good 88 to
   22) and QOL score was 75 +/- 16 and 75 +/- 15 (score range of bad to
   good 0 to 100) at 3 months and 1 year, respectively. CBS and QOL
   correlated with each other and with patient (age, dependency, and mood),
   caregiver (age, gender, mood, and training), and support (social
   services and family networks) variables. Of these, only patient and
   caregiver emotional status, caregiver age and gender, and participation
   in caregiver training were independent predictors of either outcome at 3
   months. Patient dependency and family support were additional
   independent predictors at 1 year. Social services support predicted
   institutionalization but not caregiver outcomes.
   Conclusion - Advancing age and anxiety in patients and caregivers, high
   dependency, and poor family support identify caregivers at risk of
   adverse outcomes, which may be reduced by caregiver training.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose - We examined longitudinal changes of quality of
   life (QOL) covering physical and mental factors in an unselected group
   of stroke patients and their informal caregivers. Our hypothesis was
   that informal caregivers would have better QOL than patients at both
   follow-ups, and that changes, if any, would be related to the patients'
   status.
   Methods - QOL of 304 consecutive stroke patients and their 234 informal
   caregivers from the population-based Lund Stroke Register was assessed 4
   months after stroke onset with the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire.
   SF-36 was repeated for both groups after 16 months together with Mini
   Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-20)
   for patients.
   Results - The patients' mean QOL scores improved between 4 and 16 months
   after stroke in the socio-emotional and mental SF-36 domains and
   decreased in the domain physical function. Multivariate analyses showed
   that the patients' most important determinants of QOL after 16 months
   were GDS-20 score, functional status, age, and gender. Informal
   caregivers had better QOL than patients except for the domain role
   emotional and the mental component summary. The caregivers' most
   important determinants of QOL were their own age and the patients'
   functional status.
   Conclusions - Our study highlights depressive symptoms in determining
   QOL of stroke patients. Despite self-perceived deterioration in physical
   function over time, several other components of QOL improved, suggesting
   internal adaptation to changes in their life situations. Informal
   caregivers of stroke patients may be under considerable strain as
   suggested by their lower emotional - mental scores.},

Abstract = {BackgroundResearch resources should address the issues that are most
   important to people affected by a particular healthcare problem.
   Systematic identification of stroke survivor, caregiver, and health
   professional priorities would ensure that scarce research resources are
   directed to areas that matter most to people affected by stroke.
   AimsWe aimed to identify the top 10 research priorities relating to life
   after stroke, as agreed by stroke survivors, caregivers, and health
   professionals.
   MethodsKey stages involved establishing a priority setting partnership;
   gathering treatment uncertainties from stroke survivors, caregivers, and
   health professionals relating to life after stroke (using surveys
   administered by e-mail, post, and at face-to-face meetings); checking
   submitted treatment uncertainties to ensure that they were clear,
   unanswered questions about the effects of a treatment/intervention;
   interim prioritization to identify the highest priority questions
   (objectively identified from ranking of personal priorities by original
   survey respondents); and a final consensus meeting to reach agreement on
   the top 10 research priorities.
   ResultsWe gathered 548 research questions that were refined into 226
   unique unanswered treatment uncertainties. Ninety-seven respondents
   completed the interim prioritization process, objectively identifying 24
   shared priority treatment uncertainties. A representative group of 28
   stroke survivors, caregivers, and health professionals attended a final
   meeting, reaching consensus on the top 10 research priorities relating
   to life after stroke. Six of the agreed top 10 research priorities
   related to specific stroke-related impairments, including cognition,
   aphasia, vision, upper limb, mobility, and fatigue. Three related to
   more social aspects of living with stroke' including coming to terms
   with long-term consequences, confidence, and helping stroke survivors
   and their families cope' with speech problems. One related to the
   secondary consequences of stroke and subsequent stroke prevention.
   ConclusionsThe top 10 research priorities relating to life after stroke
   have been identified using a rigorous and person-centered approach.
   These should be used to inform the prioritization and funding of future
   research relating to life after stroke.},

Abstract = {Objective: the present study had two main purposes: 1. To examine the
   relationship between caregiver burden and health-related quality of life
   in family caregivers of older stroke patients in Japan; and 2. To
   examine which characteristics of the caregiving situation significantly
   relate to increased burden.
   Methods: subjects (n = 100) were recruited from seven randomly selected
   neurological hospitals with out-patient rehabilitation clinics in
   western Japan and interviewed using the Zarit Burden Interview, the
   Modified Barthel Index, the Geriatric Depression Scale and the SF-12
   Health Survey for health-related quality of life.
   Results: increased caregiver burden was significantly related to
   worsening health-related quality of life, particularly worsening mental
   health (Geriatric Depression Scale and SF-12 items), even after
   controlling for caregiver age, sex, chronic illness, average caregiving
   hours/day, and functional dependence of the care-recipient.
   Discussion: findings indicate that increased burden significantly
   relates to decreased health-related quality of life among stroke
   caregivers. In addition, the prevalence of depressive symptoms among
   caregivers was twice that of community dwelling older people. Roughly
   52\% of caregivers had Geriatric Depression Scale scores that warranted
   further evaluation. Despite the prevalence of depressive symptoms only

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-We aimed to assess the prevalence of depressive
   symptoms among caregivers of stroke survivors and to determine which
   patient- or stroke-related factors are associated with and can be used
   to predict caregiver depression during an 18-month follow-up after
   stroke.
   Methods-We examined 98 caregivers of 100 consecutive patients
   experiencing their first ischemic stroke in Helsinki University Central
   Hospital. The caregivers were interviewed at the acute phase and at 6
   months and 18 months. Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression
   Inventory. The neurological, functional, cognitive, and emotional status
   of the patients was assessed 5X during the follow-up with a
   comprehensive test battery.
   Results-A total of 30\% to 33\% of all caregivers were depressed during
   the follow-up; the rates were higher than those of the patients. At the
   acute phase, caregiver depression was associated with stroke severity
   and older age of the patient, and at 18 months the older age of the
   patient was associated with depression of the spouses. In later
   follow-up, caregiver depression was best predicted by the caregiver's
   depression at acute phase.
   Conclusions-Identifying those caregivers at highest risk for poor
   emotional outcome in follow-up requires not only assessment of patient-
   related factors but also interview of the caregiver during the early
   poststroke period.},

Abstract = {Among the estimated 20\% to 40\% of stroke survivors who develop
   spasticity, the burden of this condition on patients, caregivers, and
   society is substantial. Stroke survivors with spasticity may experience
   reductions in their ability to perform activities of daily living and in
   their health-related quality of life. The occurrence of spasticity in
   stroke survivors may also result in an increased burden on their
   caregivers, who exhibit poorer physical and emotional health as compared
   with the general population. The responsibilities that caregivers have
   to the stroke survivor-in terms of providing medical care, protecting
   from falls, and assisting with feeding and hygiene, among other tasks of
   daily living-must be balanced with their responsibilities to other
   family members and to themselves. Caregivers of stroke survivors often
   report a feeling of confinement with little opportunity for relief, and
   although social support can be helpful, it is frequently limited in its
   availability. In terms of the socioeconomic burden of spasticity after
   stroke, recent data point to a 4-fold increase in health care costs
   associated with stroke survivors with spasticity compared with stroke
   survivors without spasticity. Thus, it is important to reduce the burden
   of spasticity after stroke. Consequently, effective spasticity treatment
   that reduces spasticity and the level of disability experienced by
   stroke survivors will likely increase their functioning and their
   health-related quality of life and will also result in a diminished
   burden on their caregivers. Neurology (R) 2013;80(Suppl 2):S45-S52},

Abstract = {Purpose: Approximately 4.8 million stroke survivors are living in the
   community with some level of disability requiring the assistance of
   family caregivers. Stroke family caregivers are often unprepared for the
   demands required of them. The purpose of this grounded theory study was
   to explore the needs of stroke patients and their family caregivers as
   they transitioned through the stroke care continuum from acute care to
   inpatient rehabilitation to home. Methods: Thirty-eight participants, 19
   recovering stroke patients (11 male, 8 female), 15 primary family
   caregivers (14 spouses, 1 mother), and 4 adult children were interviewed
   during their stay at a rehabilitation facility and within 6 months of
   discharge. Interview questions were loosely structured and focused on
   the stroke experience and how patients and caregivers were managing
   postdischarge. Data were analyzed using dimensional and comparative
   analysis. Results: Findings were organized in a conceptual framework
   illustrating the trajectory of the crisis of stroke. Stroke survivors
   and their caregivers faced enormous challenges as they moved through 3
   phases of the trajectory: the stroke crisis, expectations for recovery,
   and the crisis of discharge. Findings from this study suggest that as
   caregivers move through the phases of the trajectory, they do not have a
   good understanding of the role to which they are committing, and they
   are often underprepared to take on even the basic tasks to meet the
   patients' needs on discharge. Conclusion: Stroke survivors and their
   caregivers do not have adequate time to deal with the shock and crisis
   of the stroke event, let alone the crisis of discharge and all of the
   new responsibilities with which they must deal.},

Abstract = {Background: We assessed the objective and subjective burden of
   caregiving for stroke patients and investigated which characteristics of
   the patient, the informal caregiver and the objective burden contribute
   most to subjective burden and to the condition of feeling substantially
   burdened. Methods: We studied a sample of 151 stroke survivors and their
   primary informal caregivers. We collected data through patient and
   caregiver interviews 6 months after stroke. Results: Both the level of
   subjective burden and the condition of feeling substantially burdened
   were associated with both caregiver's and patient's health-related
   quality of life, patient's age, and the number of caregiving tasks
   performed. Conclusions: These conditions can be used in clinical
   practice to identify potentially vulnerable caregivers in need of
   support and at risk of adverse health effects. Monitoring stroke
   survivors as well as their family caregivers at discharge may help to
   prevent or alleviate caregiver burden. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG,

Title = {Caregiving Strain and Estimated Risk for Stroke and Coronary Heart
   Disease Among Spouse Caregivers Differential Effects by Race and Sex},
Journal = {STROKE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {331-336},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Psychosocial stress has been widely studied as a
   risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) but little is
   known about the differential effects of stress on stroke and CHD risk by
   race and sex. Caregiving for a disabled spouse has been associated with
   increased mortality and CHD risk, but the association of caregiving
   strain with stroke and CHD risk across race and sex is unknown.
   Methods-Participants in the REasons for Geographic and Racial
   Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study who were providing in-home
   caregiving to a disabled spouse reported on caregiving strain (high,
   some, or none), depressive symptoms, social network, education, and age.
   Caregiving strain groups were compared on the Framingham Stroke Risk
   Score (N = 716) and Framingham CHD Risk Score (N = 607), which estimate
   the projected 10-year risk of incident stroke and ischemic heart
   disease, respectively.
   Results-High caregiving strain was associated with a 23\% higher
   covariate-adjusted estimated stroke risk (11.06\% for caregivers with no
   strain versus 13.62\% risk for high-strain caregivers). This association
   was stronger in men, particularly African American men with high
   caregiving strain (26.95\% estimated 10-year stroke risk). Caregiving
   strain was not associated with CHD risk scores.
   Conclusions-Caregiving strain is significantly associated with higher
   estimated stroke risk with greatest effects for men, particularly
   African American men, providing caregiving to their wives. Male spouse
   caregivers may need special caregiving support. Prospective longitudinal
   studies should examine how sex and race may moderate the impact of
   stress on stroke and CHD risk. (Stroke. 2010;41:331-336.)},

Journal = {DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Purpose: Family caregivers provide essential support as stroke
   survivors' return to community living, but it is not standard clinical
   practice to prepare or provide ongoing support for their care-giving
   role. In addition, health care professionals (HCPs) experiences with
   providing support to caregivers have not been explored previously. The
   objectives of this qualitative study were to: (1) explore the support
   needs over time from the perspective of caregivers, (2) explore the
   support needs over time from the perspective of HCPs, and (3) compare
   and contrast caregivers' and HCPs' perspectives. Methods: A qualitative
   study with stroke family caregivers (n = 24) and HCPs (n = 14). In-depth
   interviews were audio taped, transcribed, and analyzed using Framework
   Analysis. Results: Three main themes emerged concerning: (1) types and
   intensity of support needed; (2) who provides support and the method of
   providing support; and (3) primary focus of care. These themes are
   discussed in relation to the TIR framework. Conclusions: Caregivers'
   needs for support and the individuals most suited to providing support
   change across the stroke survivor's recovery trajectory. Changes to
   service delivery to better support caregivers may include: (1)
   addressing caregivers' changing needs across the care continuum; (2)
   implementing a family-centered model of care; and (3) providing 7-day
   per week inpatient rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {Objective: To quantify time caring, burden and health status in carers
   of stroke patients after discharge from rehabilitation; to identify the
   potentially modifiable sociodemographic and clinical characteristics
   associated with these outcomes.
   Methods: Patients and carers prospectively interviewed 6 (n = 71) and 12
   (n = 57) months after discharge. Relationships of carer and patient
   variables with burden, health status and time analysed by Gaussian and
   Poisson regression.
   Results: Carers showed considerable burden at 6 and 12 months. Carers
   spent 4.6 and 3.6 hours per day assisting patients with daily activities
   at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Improved patient motor and cognitive
   function were associated with reductions of up to 20 minutes per day in
   time spent in daily activities. Better patient mental health and
   cognitive function were associated with better carer mental health.
   Conclusions: Potentially modifiable factors such as these may be able to
   be targeted by caregiver training, support and education programmes and
   outpatient therapy for patients.},

Title = {Problems and Benefits Reported by Stroke Family Caregivers Results From
   a Prospective Epidemiological Study},
Journal = {STROKE},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Stroke symptoms can be very stressful for family
   caregivers, but most knowledge about the prevalence and stressfulness of
   stroke-related patient problems is derived from convenience samples. In
   addition, little is known about perceived benefits of the stroke
   caregiving experience. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   prevalence and stressfulness of stroke-related problems, and perceived
   benefits of caregiving, as reported by an epidemiologically derived
   sample of caregivers of stroke survivors.
   Methods-Stroke survivors (N=75) from a prospective epidemiological study
   of stroke, the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
   (REGARDS) study, and their family caregivers were followed. Caregivers
   were given a comprehensive telephone interview 8 to 12 months after the
   stroke, using measures of stroke patient problems, caregiver appraisals
   of the stressfulness of these problems, and perceived benefits of
   caregiving.
   Results-Caregivers rated patient problems with mood (depression,
   loneliness and anxiety), memory, and physical care (bowel control), as
   the most stressful, but reported prevalence of these problems was lower
   than those reported previously in studies using clinical samples.
   Caregivers also reported many benefits from caregiving, with over 90\%
   reporting that caregiving enabled them to appreciate life more.
   Conclusions-Epidemiologically based studies of stroke caregiving provide
   a unique picture of caregiver strains and benefits compared with
   clinical studies, which tend to over-represent more impaired patients.
   Support for caregivers should include interventions to aid their coping
   with highly stressful mood, physical care, and cognitive problems of
   stroke patients, but should also attend to perceived benefits of
   caregiving. (Stroke. 2009; 40: 2129-2133.)},

Abstract = {Objective: To elucidate the factors related to the caregiver burden in
   stroke survivors in Seoul, Korea.
   Design: Cross-sectional Study.
   Setting: Outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Korea.
   Participants: We randomly selected 340 stroke patients and evaluated
   them for 3 years poststroke. Among them, 147 caregivers and patients
   were finally interviewed.
   Interventions: Patients' demographic data, neurologic symptoms,
   depression, ernotional incontinence, and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS)
   score were assessed. In addition, primary caregivers' demographic data,
   hours of care per day, relationship with the patients, health status,
   anxiety and depression, and the presence of alternative caregivers were
   assessed.
   Main Outcome Measures: Caregiver burden was evaluated with the Sense of
   Competence Questionnaire, which has 3 subdomains with a total of 27
   items.
   Results: Caregiver burden score was high as compared with reports from
   Western society. Patient factors related to the burden scores were being
   unemployed (P <.05), the presence of diabetes mellitus (P < .05),
   aphasia (P < .01), dysarthria (P < .05), dysphagia (P < .01), cognitive
   dysfunction (P < .01), severe MRS score (P < .01), emotional
   incontinence (P < .05), and depression (P < .01). Caregiver factors
   related to high burden scores were being fernale (P < .05), unemployment
   (P < .01), being daughters-in-law (P < .01), anxiety (P < .01),
   depression (P < .01), and long caregiving hours (P < .05). On
   multivariate analysis, the most significant predictor for overall
   caregiver burden was caregiver anxiety followed by patient MRS score and
   caregivers being daughters-in-law. Caregiver depression, current
   employment status, and patient depression were also factors related to
   their burden.
   Conclusions: Caregiver anxiety, patient physical deficits, and
   caregivers being daughter-in-law are important factors related to the
   caregiver burden in our population. Strategies to reduce caregiver
   burden should be developed based on understanding of these factors. (c)

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the relationship between anxiety/depression
   and caregiver burden in informal caregivers of stroke survivors with
   spasticity.
   Design: Data were collected via online surveys from informal caregivers
   18 years or older who cared for stroke survivors.
   Setting: Internet-based survey.
   Participants: 2007 through 2009 U.S. National Health and Wellness Survey
   database or Lightspeed Research general panel respondents (N =153).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Anxiety and depression were self-reported by the
   caregiver as a physician diagnosis. Depression severity was measured by
   the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Caregiver burden was
   measured by the Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) and the Bakas
   Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS). Logistic regression analyses were
   conducted with anxiety, depression, and the PHQ-9 depression severity
   categories as a result of each caregiver burden scale.
   Results: Data were analyzed for 153 informal caregivers; they were
   mostly women (70.6\%) and white (78.4\%), with a mean age of 51.6 years.
   For every 1-point increase in the OCBS Difficulty Scale, the odds of
   anxiety or depression were 2,57 times as great (P<.001) and 1.88 times
   as great (P=.007), respectively. The odds of PHQ-9 severe depression
   versus all other categories combined were 2.48 times as great (P<.001).
   For every 1-point decrease in the BCOS, the odds of anxiety or
   depression were 2.43 times as great (P<.001) and 2.27 times as great
   (P=.002), respectively. The odds of PHQ-9 severe depression versus all
   other categories combined were 4.55 times as great (P<001).
   Conclusions: As caregiver burden increases, caregivers are more likely
   to have anxiety and depression. Depression severity also increases.
   Providing treatment to stroke survivors with spasticity that lessens the
   time and more importantly, the difficulty of caregiving may lead to a
   reduction in caregiver anxiety and depression. (C) 2013 by the American

Abstract = {Background Most patients who have had a stroke are dependent on informal
   caregivers for activities of daily living. The TRACS trial investigated
   a training programme for caregivers (the London Stroke Carers Training
   Course, LSCTC) on physical and psychological outcomes, including
   cost-effectiveness, for patients and caregivers after a disabling
   stroke.
   Methods We undertook a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised
   controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis. Stroke
   units were eligible if four of five criteria used to define a stroke
   unit were met, a substantial number of patients on the unit had a
   diagnosis of stroke, staff were able to deliver the LSCTC, and most
   patients were discharged to a permanent place of residence. Stroke units
   were randomly assigned to either LSCTC or usual care (control group),
   stratified by geographical region and quality of care, and using blocks
   of size 2. Patients with a diagnosis of stroke, likely to return home
   with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were
   eligible. The primary outcome for patients was self-reported extended
   activities of daily living at 6 months, measured with the Nottingham
   Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) scale. The primary outcome
   for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months, measured with the
   caregivers burden scale (CBS). We combined patient and caregiver costs
   with primary outcomes and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to assess
   cost-effectiveness. This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com,
   number ISRCTN 49208824.
   Findings We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility, of which 36 were
   randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group.
   Between Feb 27, 2008, and Feb 9, 2010, 928 patient and caregiver dyads
   were registered, of which 450 were in the intervention group, and 478 in
   the control group. Patients' self-reported extended activities of daily
   living did not differ between groups at 6 months (adjusted mean NEADL
   score 27.4 in the intervention group versus 27.6 in the control group,
   difference -0.2 points {[}95\% CI -3.0 to 2.5], p value=0.866,
   ICC=0.027). The caregiver burden scale did not differ between groups
   either (adjusted mean CBS 45.5 in the intervention group versus 45.0 in
   the control group, difference 0.5 points {[}95\% CI -1.7 to 2.7], p
   value=0.660, ICC=0.013). Patient and caregiver costs were similar in
   both groups (length of the initial stroke admission and associated costs
   were 13 pound 127 for the intervention group and 12 pound 471 for the
   control group; adjusted mean difference 1243 pound {[}95\% CI -1533 to
   4019]; p value=0.380). Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on
   QALYs were low.
   Interpretation In a large scale, robust evaluation, results from this
   study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any
   of the assessed outcomes. The immediate period after stroke might not be
   the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training.},

Title = {Reducing Depression in Stroke Survivors and Their Informal Caregivers: A
   Randomized Clinical Trial of a Web-Based Intervention},

Abstract = {Purpose/Objectives: To develop and test the efficacy of a Web-based
   intervention for alleviating depression in male stroke survivors (SSs)
   and their spousal caregivers (CGs) that blends both peer and
   professional support. Design and Methods: The research consisted of an
   intervention protocol evaluated by a focus group of rehabilitation
   professionals, a ``think aloud{''} session conducted with female stroke
   CGs, and a usability test of the intervention's online features with 7
   female stroke CGs. Efficacy of the final protocol was tested in a
   2-group randomized clinical trial with a sample of 32 CG-SS dyads. The
   CGs in the intervention condition received an online group intervention.
   Intervention components were based on the Stress Process Model. Those
   CGs in a control condition received minimal support with individualized
   access to relevant online information. Measures of depression, as well
   as the secondary outcomes of mastery, self-esteem, and social support,
   were obtained from SSs and CGs at pretest, posttest, and 1-month later.
   Results: At posttest and 1 month later, CGs in the intervention
   condition reported significantly lower depression than CGs in the
   control condition with baseline depression controlled. There was no
   significant effect on depression among SSs. Although no significant
   treatment effects for either SSs or CGs were found on the secondary
   outcomes, posttreatment changes on some constructs were significantly
   correlated with change in depression. Conclusions/Implications: CGs
   benefit from Web-based programs that help them better understand both
   their emotional needs and those of the SS.},

Abstract = {Background-Spousal caregivers of cancer patients suffer psychological
   and physical burdens that may affect their risk of subsequently
   developing coronary heart disease and stroke.
   Methods and Results-Cancer patients were identified in the Swedish
   Cancer Registry, and information on their spouses was retrieved from the
   Swedish Multi-Generation Register. Follow-up of caregivers was performed
   from the date of the first diagnosis of cancer in their spouses through
   2008. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for spousal
   caregivers of cancer patients compared with those without an affected
   spouse. After the cancer diagnosis in wives, the risks of coronary heart
   disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke in husbands were 1.13
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.10- 1.16), 1.24 (95\% CI,
   1.21-1.27), and 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.18-1.32), respectively. The
   corresponding risks in wives with an affected husband were 1.13 (95\%
   CI, 1.10- 1.16), 1.29(95\% CI, 1.26-1.32), and 1.27 (95\% CI,
   1.19-1.34). The increases were consistent over time and were more
   pronounced if the spouse was affected by a cancer with a high mortality
   rate, such as pancreatic and lung cancers.
   Conclusions-Spousal caregivers of cancer patients have increased risks
   of coronary heart disease and stroke that persist over time. Clinical
   attention should be paid to spousal caregivers, especially those caring
   for cancer patients with high mortality rates. (Circulation.

Title = {Caregiver strain in spouses of stroke patients},
Journal = {CLINICAL REHABILITATION},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {312-317},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: To test the ability of a previously generated logistic
   regression model to predict caregiver strain from carer mood, negative
   affectivity and perceived patient functional ability.
   Design: Postal prospective survey.
   Setting: Spouses of community-residing patients identified from hospital
   stroke registers.
   Method: Spouses were assessed at three and six months after stroke. A
   previously derived equation was used to make predictions at three months
   of their level of strain at six months, which were compared with
   observed outcomes.
   Measures: Spouses were asked to complete the Caregiver Strain Index
   (CSI), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Positive and
   Negative Affectivity Schedule (PANAS) and to assess patients'
   independence in activities of daily living on the Extended Activities of
   Daily Living Scale (EADL).
   Results: Of 409 stroke patients, 276 had an identifiable co-resident
   spouse and 116 (42\%) completed the measures. At three months after
   stroke, 39 carers (34\%) were under significant strain with 40 (35\%)
   under strain at six months. The predictive model using the GHQ-12, PANAS
   and EADL at three months was 78\% accurate in predicting levels of
   caregiver strain at six months.
   Conclusion: Carers at risk of later strain could be identified for
   further followup. Services to provide emotional support to carers might
   be effective in the reduction of carer strain.},

Title = {Costs and caregiver consequences of early supported discharge for stroke
   patients},
Journal = {STROKE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {528-536},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Early supported discharge (ESD) for stroke has
   been shown to yield outcomes similar to or better than those of
   conventional care, but there is less information on the impact on costs
   and on the caregiver. The purpose of this study is to estimate the costs
   associated with an ESD program compared with those of usual care.
   Methods-We conducted a randomized controlled trial of stroke patients
   who required rehabilitation services and who had a caregiver at home.
   Results-Acute-care costs incurred before randomization when patients
   were medically ready for discharge averaged \$3251 per person. The costs
   for the balance of the acute-care stay, from randomization to discharge,
   were \$1383 for the home group and \$2220 for the usual care group. The
   average cost of providing the 4-week home intervention service was \$943
   per person. The total cost generated by persons assigned to the home
   group averaged \$7784 per person, significantly lower than the \$11 065
   per person for those assigned to usual care. A large proportion of the
   cost differential between the 2 groups arose from readmissions, for
   which the usual care group generated costs more than quadruple those of
   the home intervention group.
   Conclusions-Providing care at home was no more (or less) expensive for
   those with greater functional limitation than for those with less.
   Caregivers in the ESD group scored consistently lower on the Burden
   Index than caregivers with usual care, even caregivers of persons with
   major functional limitations. For persons recovering from stroke and
   their families, ESD provides a cost-effective alternative to usual care.},

   associated feelings experienced by family caregivers of stroke survivors
   during the first month after returning home. Safety, difficulty in
   managing activities of daily living, and cognitive, behavioral and
   emotional changes of stroke survivors (for example, mood swings, lack of
   motivation, forgetfulness and memory loss, depression and calling the
   caregiver often) were the three most common problems experienced by
   caregivers during the first month. Other problems were loss of caregiver
   independence, confinement, tiredness and inadequate time to do
   caregiving tasks as well as managing stroke survivor physical symptoms,
   for example, pain, not eating and skin problems. The first month of
   caregiving is very dynamic and distressful for caregivers of stroke
   survivors and telephone contacts appear to be beneficial in assisting
   caregivers to cope with the caregiving process.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study describes levels of stress in stroke survivors and
   spousal caregivers and identifies predictors of stress in couples during
   their first year at home. Method: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was
   administered to 159 stroke survivors and caregivers at discharge and at
   3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Other variables tested included stroke survivor
   function (FIMT (TM)), health status, mutuality, stroke impact (SIS),
   caregiver coping (F-COPES), support (MOS Social Support Survey), and
   preparedness. Repeated measures analyses of PSS scores were conducted
   with linear mixed models for stroke survivors and caregivers. Results:
   PSS scores for stroke survivors and caregivers were positively
   correlated (p<.01). Scores decreased significantly over the year, but
   caregivers had higher scores initially and decreased less. Stroke
   survivor function was a significant predictor of stress for both
   survivors and caregivers. Preparation was the most powerful predictor of
   stress in caregivers, whereas mutuality was the strongest predictor for
   stroke survivors. Good health, social support, and coping were
   associated with less stress. Conclusions: Stress is increased by poor
   function and mediated by internal and external buffers including health,
   the dyadic relationship, coping ability, and social support. More
   research using a dyadic research approach is needed to better understand
   stress within couples.},

Abstract = {Purpose: We examined the sense of being a burden to others or
   self-perceived burden (SPB) in people with stroke. Method: A mail survey
   was completed by 57 former inpatients and their partner caregivers. The
   care recipient survey included measures of functional status, quality of
   life, marital satisfaction, equity in the relationship, and
   psychological distress, as well as SPB using the Self-Perceived Burden
   Scale (SPBS; Cousineau, McDowell, Hotz, \& Hebert, 2003). The caregiver
   survey included similar measures in addition to a caregiver burden
   measure. Results: SPB was found to be a prevalent and distressing
   concern. SPBS scores correlated with measures of functional status and
   mood; however, the correlations were highest for measures of family
   roles and work/productivity. Using equity theory as a basis to examine
   the SPB construct, care recipients who perceived themselves as
   overbenefiting from the relationship had significantly higher SPB scores
   than those whose relationship was viewed as equitable or
   underbenefiting. Conclusions: For some receiving care from a partner
   after stroke is associated SPB. This sense of burden is related to
   changes in help-seeking behavior, quality of life, and distress.},

Abstract = {Adverse consequences are known to occur in family members responsible
   for providing care to stroke survivors. However, the differential effect
   of aphasic versus nonaphasic stroke on caregivers has not been Well
   studied. This study compares selected outcomes (e.g., perceived task
   difficulty, depressive symptoms, and other negative stroke-related
   outcomes) among caregivers of aphasic (n = 46) and nonaphasic (n = 113)
   stroke survivors. Results indicated that caregivers of aphasic survivors
   perceived greater difficulty With tasks and had more negative
   stroke-related outcomes than caregivers of nonaphasic survivors.
   Communication with the survivor was rated as most upsetting and
   difficult by caregivers in the aphasic group, followed by managing
   behaviors. Lack of time for family and friends was evident. Female
   caregivers and caregivers of survivors With self-care deficits also
   perceived greater difficulty with tasks and negative outcomes.
   Comprehensive assessment of the unique needs of caregivers of aphasic
   survivors is suggested for more individualized nursing interventions.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Stroke caregivers often express the need for information about
   stroke and assistance with stroke-related care in the early discharge
   period. The Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK) is an
   8-week program that addresses caregiver needs. This study explored the
   efficacy of the TASK program in improving stroke caregiver outcomes.
   Method: Guided by a conceptual model, 6 outcomes (optimism, task
   difficulty, threat appraisal, depressive symptoms, life changes, general
   health perceptions) were measured in 40 caregivers randomized to the
   TASK (n=21) or an attention control group (n=19). Data were analyzed
   using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for baseline scores
   and minutes spent with the nurse. Results: Significant increases in
   optimism at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks were found, with medium
   effect sizes for the TASK group relative to the control group (p<.05).
   Significant improvements in task difficulty at 4 weeks, and threat
   appraisal at both 8 weeks and 12 weeks were also found (p<.05).
   Conclusion: Caregivers receiving the TASK intervention improved in
   optimism, task difficulty, and threat appraisal. Further testing of an
   enhanced version of the TASK program is warranted, with attention
   directed toward more distal stroke caregiver outcomes.},

Abstract = {Objectives: (a) To determine levels of and factors explaining partners'
   burden, anxiety and depressive symptoms at two months post-stroke, (b)
   to predict partners' burden, anxiety and depressive symptoms at one year
   post-stroke based on patient and partner characteristics available at
   two months post-stroke.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study. Partners of stroke patients (N = 183)
   were included. Main outcome measures were the Caregiver Strain Index and
   the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
   Results: Many partners experienced high burden, anxiety and depressive
   symptoms. At two months post-stroke, these outcomes were associated with
   the partner variables: age, relationship satisfaction, proactive coping,
   self-efficacy, everyday social support, burden, anxiety and depressive
   symptoms; and the patient variables: stroke severity and depressive
   symptoms.
   Partner outcomes at one year post-stroke were mainly predicted by the
   level of these outcomes at two months post-stroke.
   Conclusions: Partner outcomes at two months post-stroke predict to a
   large degree partner outcomes at one year post-stroke.
   Practice implications: Measuring partners' burden and anxiety and
   depressive symptoms in the post-acute phase is recommended to trace
   partners at risk of long-term burden and emotional problems. (C) 2016

Title = {Long-term impact of stroke on family caregiver well-being A
   population-based case-control study},
Journal = {NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {84},
Number = {13},
Pages = {1323-1329},

Abstract = {Objective: Three-year changes in well-being were studied among family
   caregivers of an epidemiologically derived sample of stroke survivors
   from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
   (REGARDS) study and compared to matched noncaregivers.
   Methods: Family caregivers of REGARDS participants who experienced a
   stroke event completed telephone interviews assessing depressive
   symptoms, mental and physical health quality of life (QOL), life
   satisfaction, and leisure satisfaction at approximately 9, 18, 27, and
   36 months after the stroke (n = 235). For each stroke caregiver, a
   family member of a stroke-free REGARDS participant was enrolled as a
   matched noncaregiving control (n = 235) and completed similar
   interviews.
   Results: Multilevel longitudinal models found that caregivers showed
   poorer well-being at 9 months poststroke than controls on all measures
   except physical health QOL. Significant differences were sustained for
   22 months after the stroke event for depressive symptoms, 31 months for
   mental health QOL, and 15 months for life satisfaction. For leisure
   satisfaction, differences were still significant at 36 months
   poststroke. Caregiving effects were similar across race and sex.
   Conclusions: Stroke caregiving is associated with persistent
   psychological distress, but life satisfaction, depression, and mental
   health QOL became comparable to noncaregivers by 3 years after stroke.
   Caregiver leisure satisfaction was chronically lower than in
   noncaregivers. Intervention for stroke caregivers should recognize both
   the strains faced by caregivers and their capacity for successful coping
   over time.},

Title = {Experiences of male patients and wife-caregivers in the first year
   post-discharge following minor stroke: A descriptive qualitative study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {46},
Number = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Most patients with minor stroke are discharged directly home
   from acute care, under the assumption that little will be required in
   the way of adaptation and adjustment because informal caregivers will
   manage the stroke recovery process. We explored male patients with minor
   stroke and their wife-caregivers' perceptions of factors affecting
   quality of life and caregiver strain encountered during the first year
   post-discharge.
   Methods: Data were obtained from responses to two open-ended questions,
   part of quality of life and caregiver strain scales administered to
   participants in a larger descriptive study. Conventional content
   analysis was used to assess narrative accounts of living with minor
   stroke Provided by 26 male patients and their wife-caregivers over a
   period of 1-year post-discharge.
   Results: Two major themes that emerged from these data were `being
   vulnerable' and `realization'. Subthemes that arose within the
   vulnerability theme included changes to patients' masculine image and
   wife-caregivers' assumption of a hyper-vigilance role. In terms of
   `realization' patients and their wife-caregivers shared `loss' as well
   as `changing self and relationships'. Patients in this study focused
   primarily on their physical recovery and their perceptions of necessary
   changes. Wife-caregivers were actively involved in managing the
   day-to-day demands that stroke placed on individual, family and social
   roles.
   Conclusions: We conclude that patients and wife-caregivers expend
   considerable time and energy reestablishing control of their lives
   following minor stroke in an attempt to incorporate changes to self and
   their relationship into the fabric of their lives. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Background. Throughout the stroke rehabilitation process, community care
   is one of the most important elements. Learning to live with and take
   care of a family member with a stroke is immensely complex and
   demanding. Without appropriate support, family caregivers are at risk of
   their own general health decreasing, thus becoming a patient themselves
   - the second patient in the family.
   Aim. The aim of this study was to examine aspects of social support
   available to family caregivers during the first 12-week transitional
   period following hospital discharge.
   Design and method. This study adopted a cross-sectional descriptive
   design. Regression analysis was performed for examining the types of
   social support received and the general health of family caregivers.
   Open-ended questions were used to gain a better understanding of
   situation-specific supports including their availability, utilization
   and eventual satisfaction.
   Results. Findings confirm that home care for the stroke survivor is
   heavy and demanding. Health-related care tasks were the most stressful.
   Around 40\% of the family caregivers reported somatic symptoms. Fewer
   persons in the social network of the family caregivers had provided
   support compared with the number of support people that caregivers
   thought available. Two inadequate types of support were tangible support
   and information support. Professional advice and feedback in relation to
   home care skills were particularly lacking.
   Conclusion. Findings of this study affirmed that stroke care needs
   exceed the hospital boundary. Professional support to family caregivers
   is essential so as to sustain home care and protect the caregiver's
   health. This is particular important during the first 12 weeks
   transitional period after hospital discharge.
   Relevance to clinical practice. This study highlighted the implications
   of social support to nursing practice, especially in predischarge
   planning and community care. Findings of this study may provide
   information and data for service planning and community resources
   co-ordination to support community stroke care.},

Title = {Roles of Changing Physical Function and Caregiver Burden on Quality of
   Life in Stroke: A Longitudinal Dyadic Analysis},
Journal = {STROKE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {733-739},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine changes
   in stroke survivor and caregiver quality of life (QOL) and to determine
   whether changes in survivor physical functioning and caregiver burden
   (ie, the impact of the physical, psychological, and social demands of
   caregiving) influence changes in QOL.
   Methods Longitudinal design with 226 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads
   enrolled at survivor discharge from rehabilitation hospitals. Data
   collection was performed over 12 months. We measured survivor physical
   functioning, caregiver burden, and QOL (physical, psychological, social,
   and environmental) in both survivor and caregiver. Multilevel modeling
   was used to control for the interdependence of the data.
   Results Survivors (50\% male sex) and caregivers (66\% female sex) were
   70.8 (SD=11.9) and 52.4 (SD=13.1) years old, respectively. Over the 12
   months, stroke survivor's physical (=1.59; P<0.001) and psychological
   (=0.86; P<0.05) QOL significantly improved; social and environmental QOL
   did not P>0.05. Caregiver QOL, on average, did not significantly change
   over time P>0.05. Improvements in survivor physical functioning were
   associated with increases in survivor and caregiver physical and
   psychological QOL and survivor environmental QOL. Decreases in caregiver
   burden were significantly associated with improvements in caregiver
   physical, psychological, and environmental QOL but not with survivor
   QOL.
   Conclusions QOL of stroke survivors and caregivers covaries and is
   greatly impacted by the physical function changes of the survivor.
   Dyadic approaches to stroke rehabilitation that acknowledge the
   interdependence of dyads are needed.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the impact of stroke survivors' behavioral and
   psychologic symptoms (BPS) on informal caregivers' experience of
   depression in the context of the caregiving situation.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey using a structured quantitative
   interview.
   Setting: Rehabilitation facility outpatient clinic, tertiary care
   facility outpatient clinic, and community care organizations.
   Participants: Ninety-four informal caregivers to stroke survivors
   completed standardized measurement instruments.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Measurement instruments included the Center for
   Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Brain Impairment Behavior
   Inventory-Revised, Caregiver Assistance Scale, Caregiving Impact Scale,
   and Mastery scale.
   Results: A substantial percentage (44.7\%) of caregivers were at risk of
   clinical depression. Caregivers experienced more depression symptoms
   when they cared for stroke survivors exhibiting more BPS of memory and
   comprehension difficulties, provided less assistance, experienced more
   lifestyle interference, and had lower mastery (F-5,F-85=26.02, P<.001,
   adjusted R-2=.58).
   Conclusions: BPS exhibited by stroke survivors contribute to informal
   caregivers' experience of depression. These results can assist
   rehabilitation professionals to identify informal care providers who are
   at greater risk of experiencing emotional distress and, therefore, may
   benefit from intervention.},

Abstract = {Social support, social problem-solving abilities, and adjustment of
   family caregivers of stroke survivors. Arch Phys Med Rehabil
   2006;87:343-50.
   Objective: To determine contributions of social support and social
   problem-solving abilities in prediction of adjustment of family
   caregivers of stroke survivors.
   Design: Descriptive.
   Setting: Two rehabilitation facilities (1 private, 1 state) in the
   southeastern United States.
   Participants: Fifty-two family caregivers (46 women, 6 men) of stroke
   survivors (28 women, 24 men).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Predictor variables were social support and
   social problem-solving abilities. Outcome measures of caregiver
   adjustment were depressive symptomatology, well-being, and general
   health. Participants completed C, these measures 1 to 2 days before
   discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and at 5, 9, and 13 weeks
   postdischarge in the home.
   Results: Trajectory analysis indicated higher levels of social support
   were associated with lower levels of caregiver depressive symptomatology
   and higher levels of well-being and general health, independent of
   social problem solving. A greater negative problem orientation was
   associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology and lower
   levels of well-being. A more positive problem orientation was associated
   with greater increases in general health. The strength or slope of this
   positive relation lessened over time.
   Conclusions: Social support and the emotion-focused component of social
   problem solving, problem orientation, independently contribute to
   caregiver adjustment. Interventions that provide social support and
   assist caregivers to develop more adaptive abilities toward problem
   solving may be beneficial.},

Title = {Stroke Survivor Depressive Symptoms Are Associated With Family Caregiver
   Depression During the First 2 Years Poststroke},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Behavioral and psychological symptoms associated
   with stroke are gaining increasing attention in a field in which
   recovery of physical function has dominated. A small body of research
   has begun to suggest that stroke survivors' (SSs') behavioral and
   psychological symptoms contribute to family caregivers' experiences of
   emotional distress. The objective of this research was to determine the
   unique contribution of SS behavioral and psychological symptoms on
   caregiver emotional distress during the first 2 years poststroke.
   Method-A longitudinal cohort study was conducted of individuals who have
   survived their first stroke and their caregivers. Participants completed
   standardized measures by telephone interviews at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months
   poststroke. A subsample completed additional assessments 18 and 24
   months poststroke. These longitudinal data were analyzed using mixed
   effects modeling.
   Results-Three hundred ninety-nine SS/caregiver dyads participated.
   Overall, caregivers reported more emotional distress when caring for SSs
   exhibiting more depressive symptoms and more cognitive impairment and
   when caregivers were younger, female, in poorer physical health,
   experienced more lifestyle interference, and reported less mastery. SSs'
   physical disability, stroke severity, and comorbidity were not
   significant. The set of significant predictors remained consistent when
   examined in the subsample followed for 2 years (except SS cognitive
   impairment).
   Conclusions-Interventions aimed at improving caregiver well-being should
   focus on enhancing clinical management of SSs' depression and better
   preparing caregivers to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms. In
   addition, respite programs that encourage caregivers to maintain
   participation in valued activities may be beneficial. (Stroke.

Abstract = {Objectives: To assess the prevalence of considerable burden among
   caregivers of stroke survivors at 6 months (Time 1) and 5 years after
   stroke (Time 2), to analyse changes in burden severity over time and to
   identify factors associated with the burden.
   Methods: Eighty eight patient/caregiver pairs were assessed. Caregiver
   burden was measured with the Caregiver Burden Scale. Socio-demographic,
   stroke-related and psychological characteristics were analysed as
   potential determinants of the burden. Exact multiple logistic regression
   was used to identify the predictive factors.
   Results: Considerable burden was reported by 44\% of the caregivers at
   Time 1 and 30\% at Time 2. The burden was independently associated with
   caregivers' sense of coherence and amount of time spent caregiving at
   Time 1, and with caregivers' anxiety at Time 2.
   Conclusions: A significant proportion of the caregivers experienced
   considerable burden in the post-acute and chronic phases of stroke,
   although this proportion declined over time. Several characteristics
   were associated with the increased burden at different time points. All
   the independent predictors related to aspects of the carers.
   Practice implications: Programmes including education about coping
   strategies and time management, as well as respite care provision, could
   be beneficial and might help to reduce the burden of caregiving. (C)

Abstract = {Purpose. Many disabled stroke survivors live at home supported by
   informal caregivers. Research has revealed that these caregivers are
   experiencing strain. This study aims to examine the prevalence and
   differences over time of caregivers' strain in the first 6 months
   post-stroke and to predict caregiver strain based on patients' and
   caregivers' characteristics and service input.
   Method. Ninety consecutive patients and their caregivers were assessed
   at 2, 4 and 6 months post-stroke. The Caregiver Strain Index was used to
   evaluate strain. Patients' motor function, functional ability, health
   status, emotion and participation and caregivers' gender and relation to
   the patient and service input after discharge were measured to determine
   the predictive factors.
   Results. Nearly one out of three caregivers experienced strain. No
   differences were seen between 2, 4 and 6 months post-stroke. Correlation
   and multiple regression analyses revealed that in predicting strain, the
   patients' functional and activity level plays an important role in the
   sub-acute phase while the participation level gets more important over
   time.
   Conclusions. These findings emphasize the importance of maximal physical
   recovery and optimal reintegration in the community. This is not only
   essential for the patients themselves but also a pre-requisite to reduce
   the strain of their caregivers.},

Title = {The influence of Chinese culture on family caregivers of stroke
   survivors: A qualitative study},

Abstract = {Aims and objectivesTo explore and describe the caregiving experiences of
   Chinese stroke caregivers.
   BackgroundPrevious research has indicated that culture can have a
   significant impact on the stroke caregiving experience. Moreover, scant
   research exists on stroke caregivers' experience within the Chinese
   culture.
   DesignA qualitative descriptive design was used.
   MethodsIn-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 family
   caregivers of stroke survivors. The interviews were audiotaped,
   transcribed and analysed. Content analysis was also performed.
   FindingsTwenty-five family caregivers of stroke survivors were recruited
   for the study. On average, respondents were 66years old (range
   45-82years). Of 25 interviewees, 76\% were female, 64\% were
   spouse-caregivers and 36\% were children-caregivers. Three themes
   reflecting the influence of Chinese culture on stroke caregiving emerged
   from the interviews. (i) Caregiving role perception. Informants accepted
   caregiving for the sick family member as an expected part of life, a
   culturally prescribed obligation and an expression of reciprocal love.
   (ii) Coping strategies. Connecting with family resources and connecting
   with inner strength were frequently reported coping strategies. (iii)
   Self-sacrifice. Informants identified self-reliance and feeling of
   restraint in their utilisation or access of formal caregiving service.
   Chinese caregivers sacrifice themselves for the care recipients
   regardless of the hardships and the neglect of their own health.
   ConclusionOur findings provide a comprehensive and culturally sensitive
   perspective in understanding the experience of stroke caregivers in
   Chinese communities. Cultural and religious backgrounds were found to
   influence Chinese stroke caregivers' experience, coping strategies and
   self-sacrifice behaviour in idiosyncratic ways.
   Relevance to clinical practiceResearch on the practice of culture can
   serve as a basis for the formulation of specific policies and effective
   interventions for supporting stroke caregivers of different cultural
   backgrounds.},

Abstract = {Because treatment for stroke has improved, individuals are living longer
   with the effects of a stroke. The resulting long-term impairment can
   affect both stroke survivors' and their caregivers' health-related
   quality of life (HRQOL). Few studies have examined the HRQOL of stroke
   survivors and their caregivers greater than 2 years poststroke. The
   stroke survivors and their spousal caregivers (n = 30 dyads) who had
   previously completed a 12-month study after discharge from inpatient
   rehabilitation were assessed at 3-5 years poststroke. The HRQOL and
   related outcomes were measured for stroke survivors and caregivers. Data
   from baseline to 12 months were used in conjunction with data from this
   study. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the change in repeated
   measures over time. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the
   relationship of generic HRQOL to related psychosocial outcomes. The
   stroke survivors were an average of 4.68 years poststroke. The mean age
   for stroke survivors and caregivers was 70.8 and 64.9 years,
   respectively. Most stroke survivors were men (80\%) and non-Hispanic
   White (70\%). Among stroke survivors, depression decreased from baseline
   to 12 months (p = .04) but increased from 12 months to the end of
   follow-up (p = .003). The caregivers' depression decreased from baseline
   to all time points (p = .015). Stroke-specific HRQOL showed
   statistically significant (p < .03) decreases between 12 months and end
   of follow-up. Increased number of illnesses and older age were
   associated with caregivers' lower physical HRQOL score (p = .004).
   Higher depression was associated with lower mental HRQOL score for both
   caregivers and stroke survivors (p = .003 and p = .011, respectively).
   Both stroke survivors and caregivers continue to experience negative
   stroke-related health outcomes for many years after the initial stroke;
   some of these outcomes even worsen over time. These findings illustrate
   the need for ongoing psychological and medical evaluation for both
   long-term stroke survivors and caregivers. Development and testing of
   targeted behavioral interventions are also warranted.},

Title = {Race and Gender Differences in 1-Year Outcomes for Community-Dwelling
   Stroke Survivors With Family Caregivers},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Previous research has reported worse outcomes
   after stroke for women and for African Americans, but few prospective
   population-based studies have systematically examined demographic
   differences on long-term stroke outcomes. Race and gender differences in
   1-year stroke outcomes were examined using an epidemiologically derived
   sample of first-time stroke survivors from the national REasons for
   Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study.
   Methods-Participants of REGARDS who reported a first-time stroke event
   during regular surveillance calls were interviewed by telephone and then
   completed an in-home evaluation approximately 1 year after the verified
   first-time stroke event (N=112). A primary family caregiver was also
   enrolled and interviewed for each stroke survivor. Measures from the
   in-home evaluation included previously validated stroke outcomes
   assessments of neurological deficits, functional impairments, and
   patient-reported effects of stroke in multiple domains.
   Results-African American stroke survivors were less likely to be living
   with their primary family caregivers than white participants. Analyses
   that controlled for age, education, and whether the stroke survivors
   lived with their primary family caregivers indicated that African
   Americans and women showed significantly greater deficits on multiple
   1-year outcome measures compared to whites and men, respectively.
   Conclusions-Among community-dwelling stroke survivors with family
   caregivers, women and African Americans are at heightened risk for poor
   long-term outcomes 1 year after first-time stroke events. Rehabilitation
   services and public health policies aimed at enhancing stroke recovery
   rates should address these disparities in poststroke outcomes. (Stroke.

Abstract = {A global measure of life satisfaction has become increasingly important
   as an adjunctive outcome of healthcare interventions for people with
   disabilities, including those caused by stroke. Life satisfaction of
   stroke survivors may affect caregiving spouses, as well. The purpose of
   this study was to identify, among many physical and psychosocial
   variables, specific variables that were associated with life
   satisfaction at 12 months after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation,
   and variables that were predictive of life satisfaction 1 year later (at
   24 months). Between 12 and 24 months, life satisfaction decrcased for
   stroke survivors, while it increased for caregiving spouses. The
   relationship between the couple (mutuality) was the only variable that
   was a significant predictor of life satisfaction for both stroke
   survivors and their spouses.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the effectiveness of information provision
   strategies in improving the outcome for stroke patients and/or their
   identified caregivers.
   Data sources: We searched: the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register;
   the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; electronic databases
   MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Science Citation Index and Social
   Science Citation Index; Assia; Index to UK theses; Dissertation
   Abstracts; ongoing trials and research registers; bibliographies of
   retrieved papers, relevant articles, and books; the Journal of Advanced
   Nursing. We also contacted researchers for additional information.
   Review methods: Two review authors independently assessed trial
   eligibility, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Primary
   outcomes were knowledge about stroke and impact on mood. Meta-analyses
   were undertaken for the domains of knowledge, mood, satisfaction, and
   mortality.
   Results: Seventeen trials were identified and 11 contributed data to the
   meta-analyses. There were significant effects in favour of the
   intervention on patient knowledge (standardized mean difference (SMD)
   0.29, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.46), caregiver knowledge
   (SMD 0.74 95\% Cl 0.06 to 1.43), patient depression scores (weighted
   mean difference (WMD) -0.52, 95\% Cl -0.93 to -0.10), and one aspect of
   patient satisfaction (odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95\% Cl 1.33 to 3.23).
   Post-hoc subgroup analyses showed that strategies which actively
   involved patient and caregivers had a significantly greater effect on
   patient anxiety (P<0.05) and depression (P<0.02) than passive
   strategies.
   Conclusion: There is some evidence to support the routine provision of
   information to stroke patients and their families. Although the best way
   to provide information is still not clear, the results of this review
   suggest that strategies which actively involve patients and caregivers
   should be used in routine practice.},

Title = {Influence of stroke survivor characteristics and family conflict

Abstract = {Background: Stroke recovery is a dynamic process for stroke survivors,
   and shorter lengths of stay in healthcare settings shift the care of the
   survivors to family caregivers. The physical and mental sequelae after
   stroke and the family's response to this catastrophic event may have
   deleterious effects on caregivers.
   Objective: To examine the influence of stroke survivors' motor function,
   their memory and behavior changes, and the family conflict surrounding
   stroke recovery on the mental and physical health of caregivers during
   the subacute recovery period.
   Methods: This cross-sectional, correlational study used base-line data
   from family caregivers (n = 132) and first-time stroke survivors
   enrolled in a larger multisite study.
   Results: The caregivers were primarily White (71\%), female (74\%),
   college-educated (73\%) spouses (80\%) of survivors. Most of the
   caregivers (66\%) reported family conflict. The caregivers from families
   with lower family functioning scores reported worse mental health. The
   caregivers reported lower mental health when they were caring for stroke
   survivors with a combination of high memory/behavior changes and low
   motor function (R-2 =.30). Family conflict appears to exacerbate the
   impact of memory and behavior changes on caregiver mental health. Higher
   caregiver education and no major health problems were associated with
   better caregiver physical health (R-2 =.36). Caregiver physical health
   was not associated with family functioning or stroke survivor memory and
   behavior changes.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that memory and behavior changes of
   stroke survivors and family conflict surrounding stroke recovery are
   important considerations for assessment during the poststroke recovery
   period.},

Abstract = {Background Individuals with a strong sense of coherence (SOC), which
   considers one's ability to respond to stressors by the appropriate use
   of adaptive coping resources, can avoid breakdown when confronted with
   stress. This study examined the associations between SOC, perceived
   burden (caregiver's perception of the effect of caregiving-related
   stress) and depressive symptoms of informal caregivers (family members
   and involved friends) of stroke survivors one-month after the stroke.
   Methods One-hundred and four ethnically diverse veterans who were
   hospitalized after experiencing an acute stroke and their informal
   caregivers were enrolled in the study prior to discharge. One-month
   after being discharged from one of five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers
   in Florida and Puerto Rico, comprehensive data was collected and
   analyzed.
   Results Multiple regression analyses showed that greater SOC was
   associated with both lower burden (p < 0.0001) and fewer depressive
   symptoms (p < 0.0001). Higher caregiver burden, in turn, was
   significantly associated with more depressive symptoms (p = 0.003).
   However, when depressive symptoms was regressed on both SOC and burden
   jointly, the previously significant association between burden and
   depressive symptoms was no longer significant (p = 0.80) and SOC was
   still strongly associated with fewer depressive symptoms (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions Determining factors that may lessen burden and depressive
   symptoms for caregivers of stroke survivors during the transition period
   after discharge to their residence are imperative for developing
   successful interventions. SOC appears to be an important response in
   alleviating the levels of perceived burden and especially in depressive
   symptoms. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Background: Communication difficulties due to aphasia following stroke
   are particularly stressful to caregivers.
   Objective: To examine the impact of a psychoeducation programme on
   caregivers, burden and stress and communication between the caregiver
   and aphasic stroke patient.
   Design: Randomized wait-list controlled trial with immediate or
   three-month delayed treatment.
   Setting: Three public hospital rehabilitation services in Sydney,
   Australia.
   Subjects: Thirty-nine caregivers of aphasic stroke patients, up to 12
   months post stroke: 19 given immediate treatment and 20 in a delayed
   treatment control group.
   Interventions: Four-session weekly caregiver programme that included
   elements of education, support and communication skills conducted by a
   speech pathologist, social worker and clinical psychologist.
   Main measures: The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to
   measure caregiver stress, the Relatives' Stress Scale was used to
   measure caregiver burden and a communication questionnaire was designed
   specifically for this project.
   Results: Thirty-one caregivers completed the study. Caregivers in the
   immediate treatment group had significant reductions in GHQ measured
   stress (GHQ mean (SD) at baseline = 6.26 (5.67), GHQ post treatment 3.21
   (SD 4.20), P= 0.006). There was no improvement in wait-listed
   caregivers. Improvement was not maintained at three-month follow-up.
   There were no significant effects of the programme on communication
   skills or on caregiver burden.
   Conclusions: Stroke caregiver support, education and training programmes
   have short-term effects on caregiver stress levels but are likely to
   require ongoing involvement to maintain their effect.},

   caregiver of stroke patients},
Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Number = {40},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To investigate the anxiety/depression of caregivers of stroke patients.
   This study used a cross-sectional survey design and convenience
   sampling.
   Totally, 117 caregivers of stroke patients were enrolled. Data were
   collected from questionnaires. Hamilton anxiety scale, Hamilton
   depression scale, and Zarit caregiver burden interview were performed.
   Multiple linear regression and correlation analysis were used.
   The anxiety score, depression score and total burden score of 117 stroke
   caregivers were 16.56 +/- 8.02, 18.63 +/- 9.39, and 25.88 +/- 10.35,
   respectively. Anxiety symptoms, mild to moderate depressive symptoms,
   and severe depressive symptoms were found in 43.9\%, 26.5\%, and 27.4\%
   of the caregivers, respectively. Daily care time and medical payment
   method were influencing factors for anxiety and depression (P<.05). Both
   anxiety and depression were positively correlated with total care burden
   score (P<.01).
   Anxiety and depression are common in the caregivers of stroke patients
   and are closely related to care burdens. In this regard, appropriate
   home care guidance, psychological counseling and social support should
   be provided to the caregivers to reduce their physical and mental
   burden.},

Abstract = {As the population ages, older adults are more often living with
   functional limitations from chronic illnesses, such as stroke, and
   require assistance. Because stroke occurs suddenly, many stroke family
   caregivers in the United States are unprepared to assume caregiving
   responsibilities post-discharge. Research is limited on how family
   members become ready to assume the caregiving role. In this study, we
   developed a theoretical model for improving stroke caregiver readiness
   and identifying gaps in caregiver preparation.
   We interviewed 40 stroke family caregivers caring for 33 stroke
   survivors during inpatient rehabilitation and within 6 months
   post-discharge for this grounded theory study. Data were analyzed using
   dimensional analysis and constant comparative techniques.
   Caregivers identified critical areas where they felt unprepared to
   assume the caregiving role after discharge from inpatient
   rehabilitation. Steps to improve preparation include (a) conducting a
   risk assessment of the patient and caregiver; (b) identifying and
   prioritizing gaps between the patient's needs and caregiver's commitment
   and capacity; and (c) developing a plan for improving caregiver
   readiness.
   The model presented provides a family-centered approach for identifying
   needs and facilitating caregiver preparation. Given recent focus on
   improving care coordination, care transitions, and patient-centered care
   to help improve patient safety and reduce readmissions in this
   population, this research provides a new approach to enhance these
   outcomes among stroke survivors with family caregivers.},

Abstract = {Background and aims: Stroke survivors live with varied degrees of
   disabilities and cares are provided largely by the informal caregivers.
   This study investigated informal caregivers' burden and strains of
   caring for stroke patients.
   Method: This study involved 157 (81 males and 76 females) informal
   caregivers of stroke survivors receiving care in all secondary and
   tertiary health institutions with physiotherapy services in Lagos State,
   Nigeria. Information was collected through self-administered
   questionnaire during clinic-hours. Data was analyzed using Spearman's
   Rank Correlation Coefficient.
   Result: The patients' age ranged between 20 and 79 (mean = 59.6 +/- 14.6
   years). Sixty-one had haemorrhagic stroke while 96 had ischaemic stroke.
   The informal caregivers' age was 39.2 +/- 12.8 years (range: 17-36
   years). More (60.8\%) participants reported moderate objective while
   79.2\% had mild subjective burdens. The following factors significantly
   increased (P < 0.05) the level of burden and strains experienced by the
   informal caregivers: closer intimacy with the stroke survivors, fewer
   number of caregivers for the stroke patient, longer duration since the
   onset of stroke and more hours of caregiving per day. Caregiving had
   negative significant influence (P < 0.05) on the social, emotional,
   health and financial well-beings of the informal caregivers.
   Conclusion and recommendation: Caring for stroke survivors put social,
   emotional, health and financial burdens and strains on the informal
   caregivers. These burdens and strains increase with duration of stroke,
   intimacy, smaller number of caregivers and length of daily caregiving.
   Therefore, informal caregivers should be involved in the rehabilitation
   plan for stroke patients and their well-being should also be given
   adequate attention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background
   Caregiver burden following stroke can have significant adverse health
   consequences for caregivers and threatens the recovery and successful
   rehabilitation of patients. Our objective was to identify patient
   factors that contribute to higher levels of caregiver burden.
   Methods
   We prospectively studied patients admitted to our stroke unit over a
   2-year period (2001-2002). Data were collected at baseline and at 1
   year. Caregiver burden was measured at 1 year using the Relatives Stress
   Scale (completed by 155 caregivers) and the Bakas Caregiver Outcomes
   Scale (143 caregivers). Explanatory patient factors at baseline included
   sociodemographic status, stroke severity, stroke sub-type, functional
   disability (Barthel Index), functional handicap (Oxford Handicap Scale
   and Modified Rankin Scale), and cognitive status (orientation, clock
   drawing). At 1 year, mental health and health-related quality of life
   were assessed using the Fatigue Impact Scale, Geriatric Depression
   Scale, Global Deterioration Scale, and 36-item Short Form Health Survey.
   Results
   The baseline patient factors predictive of caregiver burden by multiple
   regression analysis were older patient age (P < 0 center dot 01), male
   gender (P < 0 center dot 05), ischemic stroke (P < 0 center dot 05),
   urinary incontinence (P < 0 center dot 0001), and impaired clock drawing
   (P < 0 center dot 05). At 1 year, significant correlates of caregiver
   burden were older patient age (P < 0 center dot 05), male gender (P < 0
   center dot 01), poor mental health (P < 0 center dot 05), functional
   handicap (P < 0 center dot 05), and functional disability (P < 0 center
   dot 001).
   Conclusions
   The functional status of patients can be used to identify caregivers at
   risk of caregiver burden. Patient demographic variables, cognitive
   function, and mental health status may further expose vulnerable
   caregivers. These factors should be considered in the development of
   strategies to offset caregiver burden.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-This proof-of-concept trial investigated the
   effects of an 8-week program of caregiver-mediated exercises commenced
   in hospital combined with tele-rehabilitation services on patient
   self-reported mobility and caregiver burden.
   Methods-Sixty-three hospitalized stroke patients (mean age 68.7, 64\%
   female) were randomly allocated to an 8-week caregiver-mediated
   exercises program with e-health support or usual care. Primary outcome
   was the Stroke Impact Scale mobility domain. Secondary outcomes included
   length of stay, other Stroke Impact Scale domains, readmissions, motor
   impairment, strength, walking ability, balance, mobility, (extended)
   activities of daily living, psychosocial functioning, self-efficacy,
   quality of life, and fatigue. Additionally, caregiver's self-reported
   fatigue, symptoms of anxiety, self-efficacy, and strain were assessed.
   Assessments were completed at baseline and at 8 and 12 weeks.
   Results-Intention-to-treat analysis showed no between-group difference
   in Stroke Impact Scale mobility (P=0.6); however, carers reported less
   fatigue (4.6, confidence interval {[}CI] 95\% 0.3-8.8; P=0.04) and
   higher self-efficacy (-3.3, CI 95\% -5.7 to -0.9; P=0.01) at week 12.
   Per-protocol analysis, examining those who were discharged home with
   tele-rehabilitation demonstrated a trend toward improved mobility (-9.8,
   CI 95\% -20.1 to 0.4; P=0.06), significantly improved extended
   activities of daily living scores at week 8 (-3.6, CI 95\% -6.3 to -0.8;
   P=0.01) and week 12 (3.0, CI 95\% -5.8 to -0.3; P=0.03), a 9-day shorter
   length of stay (P=0.046), and fewer readmissions over 12 months
   (P<0.05).
   Conclusions-Caregiver-mediated exercises supported by
   tele-rehabilitation show promise to augment intensity of practice,
   resulting in improved patient-extended activities of daily living,
   reduced length of stay with fewer readmissions post stroke, and reduced
   levels of caregiver fatigue with increased feelings of self-efficacy.
   The current findings justify a larger definite phase III randomized
   controlled trial.},

Title = {The longitudinal and dyadic effects of mutuality on perceived stress for
   stroke survivors and their spousal caregivers},

Abstract = {Objective: Functional impairment resulting from a stroke frequently
   requires the care of a family caregiver, often the spouse. This change
   in the relationship can be stressful for the couple. Thus, this study
   examined the longitudinal, dyadic relationship between caregivers' and
   stroke survivors' mutuality and caregivers' and stroke survivors'
   perceived stress.
   Method: This secondary data analysis of 159 stroke survivors and their
   spousal caregivers utilized a cross-lagged, mixed models analysis with
   the actorpartner interdependence model to examine the dyadic
   relationship between mutuality and perceived stress over the first year
   post-discharge from inpatient rehabilitation.
   Results: Caregivers' mutuality showed an actor effect (=3.82, p<0.0001)
   but not a partner effect. Thus, caregivers' mutuality influenced one's
   own perceived stress but not the stroke survivors' perceived stress.
   Stroke survivors' perceived stress showed a partner effect and affected
   caregivers' perceived stress (=0.13, p=0.047). Caregivers' perceived
   stress did not show a partner effect and did not significantly affect
   stroke survivors' perceived stress.
   Conclusion: These findings highlight the interpersonal nature of stress
   in the context of caregiving for a spouse. Caregivers are especially
   influenced by perceived stress in the spousal relationship. Couples
   should be encouraged to focus on positive aspects of the caregiving
   relationship to mitigate stress.},

Title = {A family caregiver-oriented discharge planning program for older stroke

Abstract = {Aims. To test the effectiveness of a discharge planning program for
   dyads of older stroke survivors and their family caregivers in Taiwan.
   Background. Family caregivers of stroke survivors often feel
   inadequately prepared to deal with the physical, cognitive and emotional
   needs of the stroke survivors. However, little information could be
   found on discharge planning programs for caregivers of stroke survivors
   in Asian families.
   Design. A randomised experimental design was used to explore the effects
   of a discharge planning program for 158 dyads of older stroke patients
   and their family caregivers.
   Methods. The control group (n = 86 dyads) received only routine hospital
   discharge planning services and the experimental group (n = 72 dyads)
   received routine hospital discharge planning services plus the
   caregiver-oriented discharge planning program. Outcome variables were
   measured at baseline, before discharge and one month after hospital
   discharge. Variables were measured by the Nurse Evaluation of Caregiver
   Preparation Scale, Preparedness for Caregiving Scale, Caregiver
   Discharge Needs Satisfaction Scale and Perception of Balance between
   Competing Needs Scale.
   Results. Caregivers in the experimental group had significantly better
   nurse evaluation and self-evaluation of preparation after the program
   than before, and greater satisfaction of discharge needs one month after
   discharge than before discharge. Caregivers in the experimental group
   had significantly better nurse evaluations and self-evaluations of
   preparation and better satisfaction of discharge needs after the program
   compared with the control group. However, no significant difference was
   found between caregiver groups in perceived balance of competing needs.
   Conclusions. This discharge planning program benefited family caregivers
   of older stroke patients during the transition from hospitalisation to
   one month after discharge.
   Relevance to clinical practice. This caregiver-oriented discharge
   planning program, with its emphasis on individualised health education
   and home visits following discharge may improve caregivers' preparation
   and the satisfaction of their needs during the discharge transition.},

Pages = {456-464},
Abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden differs according to the amount of care,
   but no study has really focused on that point. This study compares the
   evolution of burden of two groups of caregivers of people with a recent
   stroke who returned home after discharge from two different types of
   health care facilities. Methods: Burden was assessed at 3 weeks and 3
   and 6 months after discharge. The two groups of people with stroke and
   their caregivers were recruited from acute care (n = 69) and
   rehabilitation facilities (n = 89). Caregivers completed a questionnaire
   with three dimensions. In addition to sociodemographic characteristics,
   we assessed variables pertaining to the clinical, physical and cognitive
   functioning of the people with stroke. Results: Differences in burden
   were noted. The best predictors of burden were the caregivers'
   characteristics, i.e. gender (female), occupation (retired), schooling
   (low), age (older) and hours of care given, and the stroke survivors'
   characteristics, i.e. depressive symptoms, poor motor function (leg),
   verbal comprehension deficits, difficulty walking and neurological
   deficits. Conclusion: These results reinforce the view that services
   (information, training and support) should be tailored to the needs of
   caregivers, depending on whether or not the recipient of care has
   received rehabilitation services. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Burden and Perceived Health Status Among Caregivers of Stroke Patients},
Journal = {CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {472-480},
Abstract = {Objective: To identify the main determinants of burden and perceived
   health status in caregivers of Brazilian stroke survivors. Methods:
   Cross-sectional study. Caregivers answered the Hospital Anxiety and
   Depression Scale (HADS), Zarit caregiver burden interview (ZCBI) and
   EuroQol. Patients were assessed with the National Institute of Health
   Stroke Scale, Barthel index (BI), modified-Rankin scale (m-RS), Mini
   Mental State Examination and HADS. Results: 200 caregiver-patient dyads
   were assessed. Caregivers were significantly younger (42 vs. 57.7 years)
   and had more years of formal education (10 vs. 7.8 years); p < 0.0001.
   Seventy-seven percent of caregivers were females, and 41\% were spouses.
   The prevalence of anxiety disorders was significantly higher in female
   caregivers than in males (26.1 vs. 10.9\%; p = 0.04). ZCBI mean score
   was 27.2, and female caregivers had significantly worse scores (28.7 vs.
   22.3, p = 0.003). ZCBI mean score significantly increased (worsened) as
   the severity of the disease, based on m-RS, increased. ZCBI mean scores
   were significantly higher in wives than in other relatives (31.4 vs.
   22.6; ANOVA, p < 0.0001). The EuroQol-5D and EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale
   mean scores were 0.7 (range: 0.04-0.85) and 75.2 (range: 1-100),
   respectively. Adequate convergent validity (r = -0.38 to -0.40) between
   EuroQol and ZBCI mean scores was observed. Patient's disability (as
   measured by the BI) and caregiver's factors (female sex, depression as
   measured by HADS-depression) were independent predictors of caregiver's
   burden (r(2) adjusted = 0.48; p < 0.0001) in the multivariate regression
   analysis. Conclusions: Caregiver's mood was the most consistent factor
   influencing caregiver burden and perceived health in stroke caregivers.

Title = {Needs of family caregivers of stroke patients: a longitudinal study of
   caregivers' perspectives},
Journal = {PATIENT PREFERENCE AND ADHERENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {449-457},
Abstract = {Background: After a stroke, patients often suffer from varying degrees
   of disability that require acute inpatient treatment and extended care
   at home. Therefore, the caregivers assume multiple responsibilities that
   can result in stress, particularly when their own needs are inadequately
   addressed during the patient's recovery.
   Objectives: This study aimed to explore the changing needs of family
   caregivers of stroke patients and factors related to the needs in four
   stages, before the transfer from intensive care unit to neurological
   unit, before discharge, 2 weeks post-hospitalization, and 3 months
   post-hospitalization.
   Methods: The design of this study was based on longitudinal research,
   and the participants were family caregivers of stroke patients. Sixty
   family caregivers were recruited in this study. Data were collected at
   four time points by questionnaire.
   Results: We found that the total number of needs of family caregivers
   decreased as the illness duration increased and that needs differed
   significantly between the four time points (P<0.01). Although the needs
   were different in each stage, health information, professional support,
   and community networks were the leading need domains in all four stages.
   The major factors affecting the care needs of family caregivers were the
   National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores of patients on
   admission, length of hospital stay, and physical dependence of patients.
   Conclusion: Family caregivers expected to obtain assistance and related
   care information from professionals during the course of the disease.
   Assessing the needs of family caregivers is important for health care
   workers in understanding problems from the caregivers' perspectives.
   Relevant information and counseling should be provided to family
   caregivers to help them access support when needed.},

Title = {Implementing a training intervention to support caregivers after stroke:
   a process evaluation examining the initiation and embedding of programme
   change},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Background: Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance identifies
   implementation as a key element of the development and evaluation
   process for complex healthcare interventions. Implementation is itself a
   complex process involving the mobilization of human, material, and
   organizational resources to change practice within settings that have
   pre-existing structures, historical patterns of relationships, and
   routinized ways of working. Process evaluations enable researchers and
   clinicians to understand how implementation proceeds and what factors
   impact on intended program change. A qualitative process evaluation of
   the pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial; Training Caregivers
   after Stroke was conducted to examine how professionals were engaged in
   the work of delivering training; how they reached and involved
   caregivers for whom the intervention was most appropriate; how did those
   on whom training was targeted experience and respond to it.
   Normalization Process Theory, which focuses attention on implementing
   and embedding program change, was used as a sensitizing framework to
   examine selected findings.
   Results: Contextual factors including organizational history and team
   relationships, external policy, and service development initiatives,
   impinged on implementation of the caregiver training program in
   unintended ways that could not have been predicted through focus on
   mechanisms of individual and collective action at unit level. Factors
   that facilitated or impeded the effectiveness of the cascade training
   model used, whether and how stroke unit teams made sense of and engaged
   individually and collectively with a complex caregiver training
   intervention, and what impact these factors had on embedding the
   intervention in routine stroke unit practice were identified.
   Conclusions: Where implementation of complex interventions depends on
   multiple providers, time needs to be invested in reaching agreement on
   who will take responsibility for delivery of specific components and in
   determining how implementation and its effectiveness will be monitored.
   This goes beyond concern with intervention fidelity; explicit
   consideration also needs to be given to the implementation process in
   terms of how program change can be effected at organizational, practice,
   and service delivery levels. Normalization Process Theory's constructs
   help identify vulnerable features of implementation processes in respect
   of the work involved in embedding complex interventions.},

Abstract = {The major purpose of this study was to identify the types and frequency
   of caregiving problems and associated stress and coping effectiveness.
   Secondary purposes were (a) to examine changes in problem frequency,
   stress, and coping effectiveness over time and (b) to identify
   relationships between problem stress and personal, illness, coping, and
   well-being variables. A stress and coping model guided the study.
   Fifty-eight caregivers participated during the first 4 months of
   caregiving. Caregiver and stroke survivor demographic and well-being
   data were collected during acute rehabilitation. Three problem-related
   themes emerged: interpersonal disruptions, sustaining the self and the
   family, and stroke survivor functioning. Although problems sustaining
   the self and the family were most frequent, interpersonal disruption
   problems were rated most stressful and lowest in coping effectiveness. A
   component of emotional distress, either anxiety or depression, was
   related significantly (p < .05) to the stress level of each problem
   theme. Counseling on problem-solving strategies may improve caregiver
   well-being.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine whether family functioning is uniquely
   associated with caregiver depressive symptoms in the immediate aftermath
   of stroke.
   Design: Cross-sectional data from the baseline assessment of an
   intervention study tor stroke survivors and their families.
   Setting: Neurology inpatient service of a large urban hospital.
   Participants: Stroke survivors (n=192), each with a primary caregiver.
   The mean age of stroke survivors was 66 years, and most, 57\%, were men
   (n=110). The mean age of caregivers was 57 years, and 73\% (n=140) of
   the caregivers were women. Eighty-five percent of caregivers were white.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Measures were chosen to assess caregivers'
   depressive symptoms (Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
   Scale), family functioning, (Family Assessment Device), and additional
   factors Such as health status (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form
   Health Survey) and stroke Survivors' cognitive abilities (modified
   Mini-Mental State Examination) and functional impairments (FIM and
   Frenchay Activities Index).
   Results: Depressive symptoms were mild to moderate in 14\% and severe in
   27\% of caregivers. Family functioning was assessed as unhealthy in 34\%
   of caregiver-patient dyads. In statistical regression models, caregiver
   depression was associated with patients' sex, caregivers' general
   health, and family functioning.
   Conclusions: Forty-one percent of caregivers experienced prominent
   depressive symptoms after their family member's stroke. Higher
   depression severity in caregivers was associated with caring for a mail,
   and having worse health and poor family functioning. After stroke, the
   assessment of caregivers' health and family functioning may help
   determine which caregivers are most all risk for a depressive syndrome.},

Title = {Content Validity and Satisfaction With a Stroke Caregiver Intervention
   Program},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NURSING SCHOLARSHIP},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {368-375},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Establishing evidence of content validity and
   satisfaction is an integral part of intervention research. The purpose
   of this article is to describe content validity and satisfaction
   relative to the Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK), an
   8-week follow-up program based on individualized assessment of stroke
   caregiver needs.
   Design and Methods: The TASK intervention enables caregivers to develop
   skills based on assessment of their own needs. During the development of
   the TASK program, 10 experts rated the validity of the TASK intervention
   components for accuracy, feasibility, acceptability, and problem
   relevance. After incorporating feedback from the experts, a randomized
   controlled clinical trial was instituted using a convenience sample of
   40 stroke caregivers to determine satisfaction (usefulness, ease of use,
   and acceptability) with the TASK intervention (n=21) compared with an
   attention control group (n=19). Data collection occurred between March
   2005 and June 2006. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics,
   independent sample t tests, and content analysis.
   Findings: Expert ratings on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being strongly agree,
   provided evidence of content validity (accuracy 4.71, feasibility 4.46,
   acceptability 4.40, problem relevance 4.67). Caregivers in the TASK
   group scored significantly higher than the attention control group on
   all satisfaction measures (usefulness p=.02; ease of use p=.02;
   acceptability p=.05). Qualitative comments from caregivers provided
   further evidence of satisfaction.
   Conclusions: Evidence of content validity and user satisfaction for the
   TASK intervention relative to an attention control group was found.
   Clinical Relevance: The TASK program may be a viable telephone-based
   program that can be implemented by nurses to support family caregivers
   during the first few months after stroke survivors are discharged home.},

Title = {Combined life satisfaction of persons with stroke and their caregivers:
   associations with caregiver burden and the impact of stroke},
Journal = {HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Background: Little is known about the life satisfaction of the person
   with stroke combined with their caregiver, i.e. the dyad, despite the
   fact that life satisfaction is an important rehabilitation outcome. The
   aim of this study was to describe the dyads combined life satisfaction
   and to understand this in relationship to the perceived impact of stroke
   in everyday life and caregiver burden.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the life satisfaction of persons
   and their informal caregivers was measured in 81 dyads one year post
   stroke. Their global life satisfaction, measured with LiSat-11, was
   combined to a dyad score and the dyads were then categorized as
   satisfied, dissatisfied or discordant. The groups were compared and
   analyzed regarding levels of caregiver burden, measured with the
   Caregiver Burden scale, and the perceived impact of stroke in everyday
   life, measured with the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS).
   Results: The satisfied dyads comprised 40\%, dissatisfied 26\% and those
   that were discordant 34\%. The satisfied dyads reported a significantly
   lower impact of the stroke in everyday life compared with the dyads that
   were not satisfied. As expected, dyads that were not satisfied reported
   a significantly greater caregiver burden compared with the satisfied
   dyads. The discordant group was further broken down into a group of
   dissatisfied and satisfied caregivers. The caregivers that were not
   satisfied in the discordant group perceived a significantly greater
   level of caregiver burden compared with the satisfied group. Even
   caregivers who were satisfied with life but whose care recipients were
   not satisfied reported caregiver burden.
   Conclusions: Measuring combined life satisfaction provides a unique
   focus and appears to be a feasible way of attaining the dyads'
   perspective. The findings suggest that those dyads with a discordant
   life satisfaction could be vulnerable because of the caregivers'
   reported caregiver burden. These findings support the importance of a
   dyadic perspective and add to the understanding of the reciprocal
   influences between the caregiver and recipient. This knowledge has
   clinical implications and contributes to the identification of possible
   vulnerable dyads in need of tailored support.},

Abstract = {Aim and objective.
   To explore the long-term effects of a discharge-preparation programme
   targeting Taiwanese family caregivers of older patients with stroke.
   Background.
   Little is known about the effects of interventions for caregivers of
   patients with stroke in Asian and Chinese families.
   Design.
   A randomised experimental design was used.
   Method.
   Participants included 158 older patients with stroke (72 in the
   experimental group and 86 in the control group) and their family
   caregivers. A caregiver-oriented intervention programme was designed to
   increase caregiver preparedness, to enhance caregiver perception of
   balance between competing needs and to satisfy specific needs during the
   transition between hospitalisation and discharge. Long-term outcomes
   were measured by caregiver's health-related quality of life, quality of
   care, stroke patient's self-care ability, patient's health-related
   quality of life and service utilisation. Longitudinal data were analysed
   by the generalised estimating equation approach.
   Results.
   During the 12 months following discharge of older patients with stroke,
   caregivers in the experimental group provided significantly better
   quality of care (beta = 0 center dot 45; p = 0 center dot 03) than the
   control group. Between the sixth-twelfth months following discharge,
   patients in the control group were more likely to be institutionalised
   than those in the experimental group (chi 2 = 5 center dot 11; p = 0
   center dot 03).
   Conclusion.
   Using a sample from Taiwan, this intervention programme succeeded in
   improving quality of care provided by family caregivers to older
   patients with stroke and in decreasing the likelihood of their
   institutionalisation.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   Older Chinese patients with stroke and their family caregivers can
   benefit from an individualised programme that prepares caregivers for
   patient discharge. Similar programmes may be applicable to other
   countries with Chinese populations.},

Abstract = {The important role of family caregivers in maintaining their disabled
   and elderly members in the community is becoming increasingly
   recognized. Caregiver research, for the most part, has explored burden
   and emotional distress as outcomes of the caregiving experience.
   Although there is a growing consensus among health-care researchers
   concerning the importance of quality of life (QoL) as an outcome, there
   is little research examining QoL of family caregivers. The purpose of
   this paper, therefore, was to construct a conceptual framework from
   which to study the QoL of family caregivers of stroke survivors.
   Findings from a review of studies addressing the QoL of these caregivers
   guided the development of the model. The components of the model include
   the caregiving situation, characteristics of the caregiver, and
   environmental factors, and their proposed relationships with QoL. This
   model provides a framework for investigating how the caregiving
   experience impacts on the caregiver's QoL.},

Title = {The Role of Caregiver Involvement in Upper-Limb Treatment in Individuals
   With Subacute Stroke},
Journal = {PHYSICAL THERAPY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {90},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1302-1310},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background. Initial severity of upper-limb motor impairment and exercise
   intensity are important predictors of improved upper-limb function
   during stroke rehabilitation. Initial severity of motor impairment,
   however, is not modifiable by rehabilitation, and increased one-on-one
   treatment is not always feasible. Alternative methods to increase
   intensity and improve upper-limb function are needed.
   Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine caregiver
   involvement in upper-limb treatment as a method to improve upper-limb
   function.
   Design. This study was a secondary analysis of a multi-site randomized
   controlled trial for upper-limb recovery during subacute inpatient
   stroke rehabilitation.
   Methods. Data from 50 individuals with subacute stroke who were randomly
   assigned to the experimental group (upper-limb exercise) were used for
   the analysis. Outcome variables were measured at baseline and at
   completion of the 4-week intervention. Group comparisons between
   participants with caregiver support and participants without caregiver
   support were done using an analysis of variance. Using the Fugl-Meyer
   Upper-Limb Motor Impairment Scale and time spent in treatment
   (intensity) as covariates, a multivariate regression analysis was
   performed to determine the additive value of caregiver support on
   upper-limb function, as measured by change scores on the Chedoke Arm and
   Hand Activity Inventory and the Motor Activity Log.
   Results. Group comparisons revealed that participants with caregiver
   support had improved upper-limb function compared with those without
   caregiver support and were more likely to increase the amount of time
   spent doing exercise. The multiple regression analysis showed that
   Fugl-Meyer score, treatment intensity, and caregiver support were
   significant predictors of upper-limb improvement (R-2 = .240-.292). In
   the regression models, caregiver support accounted for 5\% to 9\% of
   upper-limb improvement.
   Limitations. Support was coded as a dichotomous variable, and thus the
   degree of support or qualitative nature of support was not captured.
   Conclusions. Involvement of caregivers was a determinant of improved
   upper-limb function over and above initial severity of motor impairment
   and exercise intensity. Further research is needed to determine the
   optimal qualitative and quantitative elements of caregiver involvement
   in stroke rehabilitation in order to maximize results.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-There are few evidence-based programs for stroke
   family caregivers postdischarge. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate efficacy of the Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit
   (TASK II), a nurse-led intervention enabling caregivers to build skills
   based on assessment of their own needs.
   Methods-A total of 254 stroke caregivers (primarily female TASK
   II/information, support, and referral 78.0\%/78.6\%; white
   70.7\%/72.1\%; about half spouses 48.4\%/46.6\%) were randomized to the
   TASK II intervention (n=123) or to an information, support, and referral
   group (n=131). Both groups received 8 weekly telephone sessions, with a
   booster at 12 weeks. General linear models with repeated measures tested
   efficacy, controlling for patient hospital days and call minutes.
   Prespecified 8-week primary outcomes were depressive symptoms (with
   Patient Health Questionnaire Depressive Symptom Scale PHQ-9 >= 5), life
   changes, and unhealthy days.
   Results-Among caregivers with baseline PHQ-9 >= 5, those randomized to
   the TASK II intervention had a greater reduction in depressive symptoms
   from baseline to 8, 24, and 52 weeks and greater improvement in life
   changes from baseline to 12 weeks compared with the information,
   support, and referral group (P<0.05); but not found for the total
   sample. Although not sustained at 12, 24, or 52 weeks, caregivers
   randomized to the TASK II intervention had a relatively greater
   reduction in unhealthy days from baseline to 8 weeks (P<0.05).
   Conclusions-The TASK II intervention reduced depressive symptoms and
   improved life changes for caregivers with mild to severe depressive
   symptoms. The TASK II intervention reduced unhealthy days for the total
   sample, although not sustained over the long term.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose. Patients with chronic stroke may benefit from
   continuing rehabilitation training after hospital discharge. This study
   examined whether caregiver-mediated, home-based intervention (CHI) could
   improve physical functioning and social participation in these patients.
   Methods. A single-blind, randomized, controlled 12-week trial conducted
   with 51 patients from 3 hospitals in Taiwan who had chronic stroke (>6
   months; Brunnstrom recovery stages III-V). Patients and their caregivers
   in the intervention arm (n = 25) were given weekly personalized CHI
   trainings designed by a physical therapist. Patients in the control arm
   (n = 26) received visits from the therapist without intervention. All
   were evaluated for physical recovery through the Stroke Impact Scale,
   Berg Balance Scale, 10-Meter Walk Test, 6-Minute Walk Test, and Barthel
   Index at baseline and endpoint. Caregivers were evaluated with the
   Caregiver Burden Scale. Results were analyzed through Mann-Whitney U
   test. Results. CHI significantly improved scores of the Stroke Impact
   Scale: strength (control vs intervention, respectively: 1.4 vs 15.5; P =
   .002), mobility (-0.5 vs 13.7; P < .001), composite physical (-0.7 vs
   11.2; P < .001), and general recovery domain (0.2 vs 17.4; P < .001).
   CHI also significantly improved free-walking velocity (-1.4 vs 7.5 cm/s;
   P = .006), 6-minute walk distance (-10.5 vs 15.8 m; P = .003), Berg
   Balance Scale score (-0.8 vs 4.5; P = .006), and Barthel Index score
   (0.6 vs 7.2; P = .008). CHI did not significantly increase caregiver
   burden at endpoint. Conclusion. CHI can improve physical functional
   recovery and, possibly, social participation in patients with chronic
   stroke.},

Abstract = {This study examined the relationships among stressors, social support,
   depressive symptoms and the general health status of Taiwanese
   caregivers of individuals with stroke or Alzheimer's disease.
   Caring for a disabled or cognitively impaired person can be extremely
   stressful and often has adverse effects on caregivers' health. While
   research on caregiving in Taiwan has examined caregivers'
   characteristics, caregivers' need and caregivers' burden in caring for
   older people in general, little is known about Taiwanese caregivers of
   individuals with stroke or Alzheimer's disease.
   Cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design.
   Data were obtained from a convenience sample of 103 Taiwanese informal
   caregivers in the South of Taiwan and analysed using descriptive
   statistics, Pearson's correlations, multiple and hierarchical
   regressions and t-tests.
   Caregivers who had lower household incomes and were taking care of
   individuals with more behaviour problems had more depressive symptoms.
   In addition, caregivers who were older and were taking care of
   individuals with more behaviour problems had worse general health.
   Caregivers who had more emotional support had less depressive symptoms.
   Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease had more depressive
   symptoms and worse general health than caregivers of persons with
   stroke. Only emotional support moderated the relationship between one of
   the stressors (household income) and depressive symptoms.
   The findings of this study may be helpful for nurses and other health
   care professionals in designing effective interventions to minimise the
   negative impacts of stressors on the psychological and general health of
   caregivers in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {Aims and objectives. The main aim of this study was to identify the
   coping strategies of stroke caregivers, to identify the factors
   associated with caregivers' depression and to identify predictors of
   caregivers' depression.
   Background. Stroke has a high incidence in China. Most stroke survivors
   are accompanied by family caregivers during hospitalisation. However,
   little is known about these informal caregivers' coping strategies to
   the consequences brought on by stroke and their depressive symptoms.
   Method. A correlation and cross-sectional design was used and a
   purposive sample of 92 stroke survivors and their caregivers completed
   the questionnaires, which were used to describe the demographic of both
   the caregiver and stroke survivor, coping strategies (the Brief COPE
   Inventory) and depression of caregivers (the Center for Epidemiologic
   Studies Depression Scale). Spearman's correlation and multiple stepwise
   regression analysis were used in data analyses.
   Results. Several coping strategies (planning, positive reframing,
   acceptance, active coping, use of instrumental support and humour) were
   most commonly used by stroke caregivers. The length of hospital stay,
   stroke survivor's cognitive status and functional status, family income
   and coping strategies such as (i) denial, (ii) self-blame, (iii)
   planning and (iv) religion had significant correlations with caregiver's
   depression. The best predictors of caregiver's depression were denial,
   planning and stroke survivor's functional status.
   Conclusion. This study contributes to our knowledge about the coping
   strategies and depression level of stroke caregivers on the Chinese
   mainland. The depression rate is very high during hospitalisation,
   although these caregivers often had positive coping responses to the
   stroke event. Many factors were associated with caregivers' depression.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses should not only pay attention to
   stroke survivors but also to their caregivers. To help them adjust well
   from the stroke consequences and avoid depression, nurses should
   implement effective interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore and describe persons with stroke and their
   caregivers' restrictions in participation in everyday occupations, i.e.
   occupational gaps, 3-6 months post-stroke, in relation to life
   satisfaction, combined life satisfaction, caregiver burden, perceived
   impact of stroke, and activities of daily living.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Subjects: Persons with stroke and their caregivers (105 dyads).
   Methods: The Occupational Gaps Questionnaire, Life Satisfaction
   Checklist, Caregiver Burden Scale, Stroke Impact Scale and Barthel Index
   were used. Correlations were analysed with Spearman's rank, and
   regression analyses used life satisfaction as the dependent variable.
   Results: At least one person in 86\% of the dyads perceived restrictions
   in participation, with the most common gap in travelling for pleasure.
   Correlations were low between the numbers of occupational gaps and life
   satisfaction (R=-0.33, R=-0.31); however, life satisfaction accounted
   for occupational gaps both for persons with stroke and for caregivers. A
   greater number of occupational gaps were perceived in the dyads with
   combined low levels of life satisfaction compared with those with
   combined high levels of life satisfaction.
   Conclusion: Participation in everyday occupations is related to life
   satisfaction even for caregivers of persons with stroke. The results of
   this study add to our knowledge about the stroke-caregiver dyad and will
   help to inform family-centred approaches within stroke rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effect of post-stroke depression (PSD) on
   rehabilitation outcome and to investigate the risk factors of PSD,
   especially, the role of caregivers type (family or professional) in
   subacute stroke patients.
   Methods Two hundred twenty-six stroke patients were enrolled
   retrospectively. All the subjects' basic characteristics, Korean version
   of the Beck Depression Inventory (K-BDI), Korean version of the Modified
   Barthel Index (K-MBI), and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were recorded
   when the patient was transferred into the Department of Rehabilitation
   Medicine and at the time of discharge. The results were statistically
   analyzed by using SPSS ver. 20.0.
   Results The patients' K-BDI score showed a significantly negative
   association with K-MBI at discharge (beta=-0.473, p<0.001) and a
   significantly positive association with the mRS score at discharge
   (beta=0.316, p<0.001). Patients with lesions on the left hemisphere
   (odds ratio {[}OR], 3.882; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.726-8.733)
   and professional caregiver support (OR, 0.028; 95\% CI, 0.012-0.065) had
   a higher rate of depression.
   Conclusion Depression was prevalent in stroke patients, and it had a
   negative effect on patients' functional outcome. Patients who had a
   lesion on the right hemisphere had less depression. The type of
   caregiver was related to the incidence of subacute PSD, and family
   caregivers were found to lower the frequency of stroke patients'
   depression.},

   Population-based study in Mumbai (India)},

Abstract = {Background: Caring for stroke patients leads to caregiver (CG) strain.
   The aims of this study are to identify factors related to increased CG
   burden in stroke survivors in a census-defined population and to assess
   the relationship between patient characteristics and CG stress.
   Materials and Methods: In a prospective population-based study, 223
   first ever stroke (FES) were identified over a 1-year period. At 28
   days, 127 (56.9) were alive and 79 (35) died, and 17 were lost to
   follow-up. One hundred and eleven CGs of 127 FES survivors agreed to
   participate. The level of stress was assessed by two scales: Oberst
   Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) and the Caregivers Strain Index (CSI) in
   CGs of survivors with mild stroke Modified Rankin Scale (MRS 1-2) and in
   those with significant disability (MRS 3-5). Results: The mean age of
   CGs was 45.6 years, approximately 22 years younger than that of the
   patients (67.5 years). Eighty-nine (80) of the CGs were females and only
   22 (20) were males. Urinary incontinence (P=0.000008), morbidity at 28
   days by MRS (P=0.0051), female gender (P=0.0183) and moderate to severe
   neurological deficit by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
   (NIHSS) on admission (P=0.0254) were factors in FES cases leading to
   major CGs stress. CG factors responsible for major stress were long
   caregiving hours (P <= 0.000001), anxiety (P <= 0.000001), disturbed
   night sleep ( P <= 0.000001), financial stress (P=0.0000108), younger
   age (P=0.0021) and CGs being daughter-in-laws (P=0.012). Conclusion:
   Similar studies using uniform methodologies would help to identify
   factors responsible for major CG stress. Integrated stroke
   rehabilitation services should address CG issues to local situations and
   include practical training in simple nursing skills and counseling
   sessions to help reduce CG burden.},

Abstract = {AimTo longitudinally describe stroke caregivers' quality of life,
   anxiety, depression and burden and to identify predictors of stroke
   caregivers' quality of life, anxiety, depression and burden.
   BackgroundCaregivers have a key role in stroke survivor care and the
   first year of caregiving is the most challenging. To give tailored
   interventions, it is important to capture changes and identify
   predictors of caregiver quality of life, anxiety, depression and burden
   during the first year.
   DesignA 12-month longitudinal study. Data were collected between June
   2013-May 2016.
   MethodsChanges in stroke caregiver quality of life, anxiety and
   depression and burden and their predictors were identified using linear
   mixed-effects models.
   ResultsThe caregivers (N=244) were 53years old and mostly female.
   Caregiver quality of life did not change significantly over the
   12months, anxiety and depression decreased up to 9months and caregiver
   burden decreased from baseline to 3months, then increased up to 9months.
   Higher caregiver quality of life was predicted by caregiver younger age,
   higher education, living with a stroke survivor, survivor older age and
   higher physical functioning; higher anxiety and depression were
   predicted by older caregiver age and younger survivor age; higher burden
   was predicted by caregiver male gender, the caregiver not living with
   survivor and survivor lower physical functioning.
   ConclusionThe first 9months of caregiving are particularly problematic
   for caregivers. The trajectories of the above variables and their
   predictors may be useful for policy makers, clinicians, investigators
   and educators to give better care to stroke caregivers and their
   survivors.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the reproducibility and responsiveness of two
   often-used instruments for caregiver burden: the Caregiver Strain Index
   and the Caregiver Reaction Assessment.
   Design: Repeated administration of self-report questionnaires three
   years post stroke.
   Subjects: Convenience sample of partners of stroke patients.
   Methods: Weighted kappa and percentage agreement at item level and
   intraclass correlations (ICCs) for subscale and total scores.
   Responsiveness was expressed as smallest detectable difference (SDD) and
   standard error of measurement (SEM).
   Results: Reproducibility of the total Caregiver Strain Index score
   (N=26) was very good (0.93; 95\% confidence interval 0.84-0.97). For the
   Caregiver Reaction Assessment (N=21), the subscales disrupted schedule,
   financial problems and health problems showed sufficient reproducibility
   (ICC 0.79-0.86), but the ICCs of the subscales lack of family support
   (0.67) and self-esteem (0.58) were insufficient. Relating the SDD and
   SEM to the standard deviation and maximum scale range, responsiveness
   appears moderate for the Caregiver Strain Index and unsatisfactory for
   the Caregiver Reaction Assessment.
   Conclusion: The Caregiver Strain Index showed good reproducibility and
   moderate responsiveness. The Caregiver Reaction Assessment showed
   insufficient reproducibility and responsiveness.},

Abstract = {The role of caregiver gender in caregiver burden and the association
   between the level of caregiver burden and institutionalization of
   elderly stroke survivors in Taiwan were explored using a correlational,
   descriptive design. The convenience sample was composed of 78 male and
   69 female primary caregivers of stroke survivors. Simple multiple
   regression and t tests were used to test the research questions. Women
   perceived caregiving as more burdensome than men did. Caregiver burden
   was most strongly associated with the characteristics of the care
   recipients and with institutionalization. The proposed model explained
   45\% and 28\% of the variance in caregiver burden for male and female
   caregivers, respectively. It is recommended that the professional
   nursing role in Taiwan be expanded to include postdischarge care,
   respite, and home-care services to allow families to keep their elderly
   at home as long as possible and to provide culturally sensitive care to
   families that might be traumatized by having to violate ethnic Chinese
   cultural norms by institutionalizing family members. (C) 2004 Wiley

   Stroke Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial},

Abstract = {Objective: Intervention trials for stroke caregivers after the early
   poststroke period are lacking. To address this gap, we examined the
   effectiveness of a problem-solving intervention (PSI) for stroke
   caregivers who provided care for at least 6 months and who experienced
   significant strain in their role. Method: One hundred twenty-two family
   caregivers (age = 66.2 years, 77.9\% female) were randomly allocated to
   a PSI or control group. The PSI was composed of 2 home visits and 18
   telephone calls delivered over a 3-month intensive intervention and a
   9-month maintenance period. PSI and control groups received monthly
   information letters in addition to usual care. Primary caregiver
   outcomes were depressive symptoms (measure: Center for Epidemiologic
   Studies-Depression Scale) and sense of competence (measure: Sense of
   Competence Questionnaire). Results: In covariance analyses, caregivers
   of the PSI group showed significantly lower levels of depressive
   symptoms after 3 months (p < .01, d = -.48) and after 12 months (p <
   .05, d = -.37), but no better sense of competence compared with the
   control group. Latent growth curve analyses revealed positive
   significant (p < .05) linear and quadratic effects of PSI on both
   primary outcomes. No effects, however, were found on caregiver
   social-problem-solving abilities. Conclusions: Although beneficial
   effects were observed among caregivers in the PSI group, the lack of
   effects on problem-solving abilities implies other characteristics of
   the intervention might account for these benefits. The relative
   intensity and therapeutic contact during the first 3 months of the
   intervention may be particularly helpful to caregivers of stroke
   survivors.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the level of burden and
   quality of life of family caregivers of stroke patients and to
   investigate the correlation between burden, quality of life (including
   physical, social, psychological, and environmental domains), age of
   caregivers, and the care period. A descriptive correlational
   cross-sectional study was performed, with a convenience sample of family
   caregivers (n = 30) of stroke patients in SAo Paulo, Brazil. Data were
   collected using a questionnaire on participants' characteristics, the
   Zarit Burden Interview Scale (ZBIS), and the World Health Organization
   Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument. A descriptive analysis
   was performed, and correlations between variables were analyzed using
   Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. The average burden
   score on the ZBIS was 29.6, representing a moderate burden, and the
   average overall quality of life score on the WHOQOL-BREF was 62.06\%,
   which indicates moderate quality of life. A significant weak negative
   correlation was observed between burden and environmental domains (r =
   -0.470; p = .009), quality of life (r = -0.414; p = .023), and physical
   domains (r = -0.394; p = .031). No significant correlations were found
   between burden and quality of life, and variables in the psychological
   and social domains, age of caregivers, or care period. Caregivers for
   stroke patients presented with moderate levels of burden and reduction
   in quality of life. Levels of burden correlated negatively with
   environmental domains, quality of life levels, and physical domains;
   however, these correlations were weak, indicating the possible
   interference of other factors.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Stroke caregivers have been identified as a group at high risk
   for poor outcomes as a result of the suddenness of stroke and a
   potentially high level of care needed due to significant functional
   limitations of the patient. However, there is little research on the
   assessment of family members who will assume the caregiving role prior
   to patient discharge from rehabilitation. The purpose of this article is
   to delineate critical assessment domains identified by a subset of
   spousal stroke caregivers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted pre- and post-discharge from rehabilitation as part of a
   larger study that focused on identifying caregiver and stroke survivor
   needs as they transitioned home from inpatient rehabilitation. For this
   study, two semi-structured interviews with 14 spousal caregivers were
   analyzed using grounded theory methods. Results: Long-term stroke
   survivor outcomes were dependent upon the commitment, capacity and
   preparedness of the family caregiver. Twelve domains of assessment were
   identified and presented. Conclusions: A comprehensive, systematic
   caregiver assessment to understand the caregiver's concerns about stroke
   should be conducted during rehabilitation to help the team to develop a
   plan to address unmet needs and better prepare family caregivers to take
   on the caregiving role.},

Abstract = {Aims and objectives To examine the relationships of social support and
   coping strategies to health-related quality of life among primary
   caregivers of stroke survivors in China.
   Background Caring for a stroke survivor is highly stressful, which can
   negatively affect a caregiver's physical and psychological well-being.
   Stroke caregivers generally report more somatic symptoms, depressive
   symptoms, sleep disorders and social isolation. They generally have
   poorer quality of life than the general population.
   Design A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study.
   Methods A quasi-random, point of reference sample of 121
   survivor-caregiver dyads was recruited from three community health
   centres and six health service stations in a city in central China. Data
   were collected in face-to-face interviews at participants' homes using
   structured questionnaires.
   Results Higher educational levels, planning and active coping were
   positively associated with health-related quality of life. The number of
   chronic conditions, hours of care per day and functional dependence of
   the survivor were negatively related to quality of life.
   Conclusion Active coping strategies predicted better health-related
   quality of life. Findings suggest that intervention programmes should be
   developed to enhance caregivers of stroke survivors' coping skills and
   improve social support for these caregivers in China.
   Relevance to clinical practiceCommunity healthcare providers may need to
   help caregivers strengthen strategies that are effective (planning,
   active coping, seeking instrumental and emotional support) and change
   those that are not helpful (venting, denial and self-blame).},

Abstract = {Purpose/Objective: Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide.
   Informal caregivers are essential in the survival of most individuals
   with stroke and may even aid in their recovery. Yet caregivers
   experience high levels of burnout, depression, burden, and physical
   illness. Research Method/Design: With structural equation modeling and
   canonical correlation analysis, links were identified between caregiver
   psychosocial variables and specific aspects of the functioning of
   individuals with stroke in 135 care recipient-caregiver dyads. Results:
   Initial analyses uncovered a medium-sized correlation between caregiver
   variables and care recipients' functioning. Follow-up analyses
   pinpointed specific links between caregivers' sense of coherence and
   care recipients' basic engagement with life and between caregivers'
   levels of burden and depression and care recipients' cognitive deficits
   and depression. Conclusions/Implications: On the basis of these
   findings, the authors propose a feedback loop wherein caregivers'
   psychosocial functioning, their quality of caregiving, and stroke
   severity and recovery are causally interconnected. Findings are
   consistent with the use of cognitive-behavioral interventions for
   caregivers, which may improve caregivers' sense of coherence, reducing
   their levels of burden and depression and leading to improved informal
   care and better recovery from stroke.},

Abstract = {The objective of this longitudinal study was to detect the relationship
   between the sense of coherence (SOC), which is an adaptive coping
   response, and depression in informal caregivers of stroke survivors
   across 2 years. One-hundred-fifteen veterans, who were hospitalized
   after experiencing an acute stroke, and their informal caregivers were
   enrolled prior to discharge. Data were collected via face-to-face
   in-home interviews at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after discharge. A
   linear mixed model was fitted to estimate the effects of the
   time-dependent covariates (SOC) while considering the dependence of
   outcome measures at repeated times. Based on the linear mixed model,
   caregivers with a stronger SOC were associated with lower levels of
   caregiver depression across 2 years following a stroke (p<0.0001). SOC
   seems to be an important aspect of a caregiver's capacity to cope after
   tending to the needs of a stroke patient.},

Abstract = {Background: Few studies have assessed the longitudinal impact of
   providing unpaid care for stroke survivors. We aimed to describe the
   positive and negative impact of providing unpaid care and to identify
   independent predictors of poor carer outcome. Methods: The Auckland
   Regional Community Stroke study was a prospective population-based
   stroke incidence study conducted in Auckland, New Zealand, over a
   12-month period in 2002-2003. Stroke survivors and their unpaid carers
   were assessed at 6 and 18 months after stroke onset using the Short Form
   36 questionnaire and the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale. Results: Data
   were available from 167 stroke survivor-carer pairs at 6 months and 62
   pairs at 18 months. Unpaid carers reported lower health-related quality
   of life at 6 months after stroke than their age- and sex-matched
   counterparts in the New Zealand population. The impact of providing care
   was predominantly negative; however, approximately one third of the
   carers had improved relationships with the stroke survivor. No reliable
   predictors of carer burden were identified. Conclusions: This study
   re-emphasises the heavy burden of stroke on unpaid carers but was unable
   to identify factors that predicted carers at the greatest risk of
   experiencing a poor outcome. Effective strategies are needed to reduce
   the burden of providing unpaid care. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {The purpose of the project was to emulate face-to-face psychosocial
   support group process in an Internet videoconferencing environment and
   explore the benefits for 34 family caregivers of persons with
   neurodegenerative disease. Caregivers were provided with computer
   equipment and trained to access a password-protected Web site. Using
   videoconferencing software, each group of 6 members met with a
   facilitator online weekly for 10 weeks. Each caregiver was interviewed
   at 6-month follow-up. Participant response data were generated through
   qualitative analysis of group process and follow-up interviews. The
   analysis showed that the virtual group process closely paralleled
   face-to-face group interactions. At follow-up, 90\% of the caregivers
   reported that the online group experience had been ``very{''} or
   ``overall{''} positive and that the group had helped them cope with the
   stresses of caregiving. The professional and ethical implications of
   providing a clinical intervention using the Internet are discussed.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a strength-oriented psychoeducation on caregiving
   competence, problem-solving abilities, psychosocial outcomes and
   physical health among family caregiver of stroke survivors: A randomised
   controlled trial},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {84-93},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Family caregivers provide the foundation for long-term home
   care of stroke survivors. The overwhelming stress associated with
   caregiving hinders the ability of family caregivers to utilise their
   internal and external resources to cope with this situation, thereby
   placing their own health at risk. We conducted a randomised controlled
   trial of a strength-oriented psychoeducational programme on conventional
   stroke rehabilitation for family caregivers.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a strength-oriented
   psychoeducational programme on the caregiving competence,
   problem-solving coping abilities, caregiver's depressive symptoms,
   caregiving burden and resources (family functioning, social support) and
   physical health (such as caregiving-related injury), as well as
   potential placement of stroke survivors.
   Design: A prospective multi-centre and single-blinded randomised
   controlled trial stratified by survivors' history of stroke.
   Setting and participants: Adult stroke patients and their family
   caregivers were recruited from the medical wards of a regional acute and
   two rehabilitation hospitals in the Eastern New Territories of Hong
   Kong.
   Methods: The design of the trial was based on the
   relational/problem-solving model. Family caregivers of stroke survivors
   who had been admitted to the study hospitals completed a set of
   questionnaires before randomisation, immediately, one- and three-months
   post-intervention. The control group received usual care, whereas the
   intervention group received an additional 26-week strength-oriented
   psychoeducational programme (two structured individual face-to-face
   pre-discharge education sessions on stroke and its associated caregiving
   skills and six biweekly post-discharge telephone-based problem-solving
   coping skills training sessions). Data were analysed using the
   generalized estimating equation and multiple regression models and
   chi-square tests.
   Results: We recruited 128 caregiver survivor dyads. The intervention
   group demonstrated significantly greater improvements throughout the
   study (p < 0.01) in terms of caregiving competence, problem-solving
   coping abilities and social support satisfaction. This group also
   displayed significantly greater improvements in terms of family
   functioning (p < 0.05) at one-month post-intervention, an increased
   number of social support (p < 0.001) and a lower level of burden at
   three-month post-intervention. However, there was no significant effect
   on enabling stroke survivors to remain in their home. Post-hoc analysis
   showed a significant and indirect effect of problem-solving coping
   abilities, which suggested its mediating effect on caregiving competence
   of stroke caregivers.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that incorporating a strength-oriented
   psychoeducational programme into the existing stroke rehabilitation
   protocol can foster a healthy transition to caregiving among family
   members of stroke survivors.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-The aim of this article was to analyze the
   likelihood of receiving informal care after a stroke and to study the
   burden and risk of burnout of primary caregivers in Spain.
   Methods-The CONOCES study is an epidemiological, observational,
   prospective, multicenter study of patients diagnosed with stroke and
   admitted to a Stroke Unit in the Spanish healthcare system. At 3 and 12
   months post-event, we estimated the time spent caring for the patient
   and the burden borne by primary caregivers. Several multivariate models
   were applied to estimate the likelihood of receiving informal
   caregiving, the burden, and the likelihood of caregivers being at a high
   risk of burnout.
   Results-Eighty percent of those still alive at 3 and 12 months
   poststroke were receiving informal care. More than 40\% of those
   receiving care needed a secondary caregiver at 3 months poststroke. The
   likelihood of receiving informal care was associated with stroke
   severity and the individual's health-related quality of life. When
   informal care was provided, both the burden borne by caregivers and the
   likelihood of caregivers being at a high risk of burnout was associated
   with (1) caregiving hours; (2) the patient's health-related quality of
   life; (3) the severity of the stroke measured at discharge; (4) the
   patient having atrial fibrillation; and (5) the degree of dependence.
   Conclusions-This study reveals the heavy burden borne by the caregivers
   of stroke survivors. Our analysis also identifies explanatory and
   predictive variables for the likelihood of receiving informal care,
   caregiver burden, and high risk of burnout.},

Abstract = {Aims and objectivesTo describe the family caregivers' caregiving
   experience for stroke survivors and to identify the determinants of
   caregiving burden over 6months.
   BackgroundSociocultural factors influence the caregiving experience in
   China. However, little is known about the dynamic changes occurring in
   Chinese caregivers' burden and its determinants.
   DesignThis is a prospective longitudinal study.
   MethodsA total of 328 participants (164 stroke survivors and 164 family
   caregivers) from the neurological units of three hospitals in Shiyan
   were examined during a 6-month period at 1-2days before discharge (T1)
   and 3weeks (T2), 3months (T3) and 6months (T4) postdischarge using the
   Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Multidimensional Scale of
   Perceived Social Support, Caregiver Strain Index and the Center for
   Epidemiological Studies-Depression.
   ResultsOf the 209 dyads recruited, 164 completed all data collection
   phases, with 69\% of the female caregivers aged 56.04 (SD=4.0;
   range=22-80) years. Caregivers reported higher mean burden at T1
   (7.352.9) but slightly decreased over time at T4 (6.343.4), had
   borderline mean depressive symptoms only in T1 (9.71 +/- 3.2) and T2
   (9.02 +/- 3.8) and had moderate mean social support throughout the
   6-month period. Determinants of caregiving burden were stroke survivors'
   physical dependence, caregivers' age, caring hours per day, depressive
   symptoms and social support, which explained 46.8\%-55.0\% of the total
   variance (p<.05).
   ConclusionCaregivers' burden remains a serious problem in the first
   6months. It is an increasing hazard, especially for those at an advanced
   age who have depressive symptoms and care for severely dependent stroke
   survivors requiring more caring hours.
   Relevance to clinical practiceNurses need to be aware of and understand
   caregivers' cultural values and beliefs about family obligations when
   considering an intervention to support them in their role at home.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To investigate differences in stroke caregiver task
   difficulty and life changes based on level of caregiver depressive
   symptoms, and to estimate probabilities among task difficulty and life
   change items.
   Design: Descriptive analysis of baseline data from an ongoing stroke
   caregiver intervention trial.
   Setting: Hospitals and rehabilitation facilities.
   Participants: Caregivers (N=242; 78.6\% women; 47.7\% spouses; 71.8\%
   white; mean age, 54.2 +/- 12.1y) caring for stroke survivors within 8
   weeks of discharge to home.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Baseline measures for task difficulty (Oberst
   Caregiving Burden Scale) and life changes (Bakas Caregiving Outcomes
   Scale) were compared based on level of depressive symptoms (Patient
   Health Questionnaire-9 {[}PHQ-9] scores <5 means no depressive symptoms;
   n=126; PHQ-9 scores >= 5 means mild to severe depressive symptoms,
   n=116). Mean scores were analyzed using general linear modeling, with
   item analyses using logistic regression and the Benjamini-Hochberg
   method to control type I error inflation.
   Results: Caregivers with mild to severe depressive symptoms have greater
   difficulty with tasks and worse life changes than those with no
   depressive symptoms (P<.001). Odds ratios were highest for the task of
   arranging care while away and for negative life changes (eg, addressing
   self-esteem, coping with stress, physical health).
   Conclusions: Findings underscore the importance of depressive symptom
   screening for stroke caregivers during or shortly after discharge.
   Assisting caregivers with depressive symptoms to arrange for respite
   care and addressing negative physical and psychological changes may be
   priority areas for future interventions. (C) 2014 by the American

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the Caregiver
   Preparedness Scale (CPS) in caregivers of stroke survivors. Background:
   Caregiver preparedness can have an important impact on both the
   caregiver and the stroke survivor. The validity and reliability of the
   CPS has not been tested for the stroke-caregiver population.
   Methods: We used a cross-sectional design to study a sample of 156
   caregivers of stroke survivors. Construct validity of the CPS was
   evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Internal consistency
   and test-retest reliability were also evaluated.
   Results: Caregivers were, on average, 54 year old (SD = 13.2) and most
   were women (64.7\%). CFA supported the unidimensionality of the scale
   (comparative fit index = 0.98). Reliability was also supported:
   item-reliability index and item total correlations above 0.30; composite
   reliability index = 0.93; Cronbach's alpha = 0.94; factor score
   determinacy = 0.97; and test-retest reliability = 0.92.
   Conclusion: The CPS is valid and reliable in caregivers of stroke
   survivors. Scores on this scale may assist health-care providers in
   identifying caregivers with less preparedness to provide specific
   interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Caregiving burden and its determinants in Polish caregivers of stroke
   survivors},

Abstract = {Introduction: Despite the growing body of literature on the consequences
   of providing non-professional care to stroke survivors, the determinants
   of caregiving burden are still not fully recognized. Identification of
   significant determinants can facilitate caregiver intervention programs.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of burden borne by
   caregivers of stroke patients and to identify the most important
   determinants of burden at 6 months after hospitalization.
   Material and methods: Data were collected from 150 pairs of stroke
   patients/caregivers. Caregiver burden was assessed on the Caregiver
   Burden scale (CB). Several characteristics were measured as potential
   predictors of the burden. Special attention was paid to the caregiver's
   sense of coherence (SOC) and anxiety. Regression analysis was employed
   to test the hypothesized relationships between these variables and the
   burden.
   Results: Forty-seven percentage of the caregivers reported a substantial
   burden (severe or moderate). Caregiver SOC (p < 0.001), anxiety (p <
   0.001) and the patients' functional status (p < 0.001) were the most
   important predictors of the overall burden and the most consistent
   predictors of the majority of aspects included in the CB scale.
   Caregiver health, patient's gender, time spent caregiving and social
   support were also factors related to the burden. The identified
   predictors explained 67\% of the variance in the overall burden.
   Conclusions: Clinicians and other professionals should focus on the
   coping abilities of caregivers, their emotional state and the level of
   patients' dependency, as these are the vital and modifiable factors
   affecting caregiver burden following stroke.},

Title = {Stroke rehabilitation: availability of a family member as caregiver and
   discharge destination},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL AND REHABILITATION MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Background. In today's health care environment where resources are
   scarce discharge planning is an important component of resource
   allocation. Knowledge of the factors that influence discharge
   disposition is fundamental to such planning. Further, return to home is
   an important outcome metric related to the effectiveness of a stroke
   rehabilitation program.
   Aim. To test the hypothesis that the patients who have a caregiver at
   home willing to participate in the care of the patient discharged from a
   stroke rehabilitation unit are more likely to be discharged home given
   other predictive factors being the same.
   Design. Retrospective cohort study using binary logistic regression
   analysis with outcome as discharge home vs. discharge not home after
   in-patient stroke rehabilitation.
   Setting. Hamilton Health Sciences multidisciplinary integrated stroke
   program unit.
   Population. During this period, 276 patients were admitted to the
   integrated stroke unit, of which 268 patients were living in the
   community prior to hospitalization. The remaining eight patients were
   admitted from a care facility, such as a nursing home or assisted living
   facility. Since a sample size of eight is too small, these patients were
   excluded from the analysis. As such, the analysis is based on the 268
   patients who were living at home prior to the onset of stroke.
   Methods. The data points collected during the study period were age,
   gender, days from stroke onset to rehabilitation unit admission,
   pre-stroke living arrangement (lived alone vs. lived with spouse,
   partner, or another family member), FIM (TM) at admission, type of
   stroke, laterality of impairment, and discharge destination (i.e.,
   private dwelling vs. nursing home, assisted living facility, or back to
   acute care).
   Results. As established by a number of previous studies, the most
   significant predictors of home as discharge destination was admission
   FIM (TM). However, the second most important predictive factor for home
   discharge was prestroke living arrangement (lived alone vs lived with
   spouse/partner/other family member) as hypothesized by the authors.
   Conclusion. Literature is rich with studies showing functional
   independence to be the most important predictor of home as discharge
   disposition but our analysis shows that pre-stroke living arrangement,
   i.e., lived alone vs lived not alone is also an important predictor for
   patients to be discharged home after stroke rehabilitation.
   Clinical rehabilitation impact. If current discharge planning relies on
   the availability of a caregiver at home after discharge from in-patient
   stroke rehabilitation then it may be worthwhile to include these
   caregivers in the inpatient rehabilitation process, to prepare them for
   their loved one's return home. Additionally, once the patient is
   discharged home more resources should be made available to support
   caregivers in the community. This may include more home healthcare
   personnel training and availability along with respite care.},

Abstract = {Purpose Preparation for caregiving is improved through engaged
   interactions between stroke family caregivers and healthcare providers
   throughout the care trajectory. We explored caregivers' perceptions
   about interactions with providers in rehabilitation, and how these
   experiences affected caregiver preparation. Design Seventeen caregivers,
   included in this grounded theory study, were interviewed during a
   rehabilitation stay and postdischarge. Data were analyzed using
   dimensional and comparative analysis. Findings Caregivers described
   interactions with providers on a continuum from collaborative to
   disconnected, and a range of strategies to enhance interactions.
   Conclusions Caregivers want to be actively engaged with providers during
   inpatient rehabilitation and collaborative interactions enhance
   preparedness and care satisfaction. Relevance Family members should be
   assessed for caregiving capacity and interactions between providers and
   caregivers should be individualized to specific needs. Providers must
   also be aware that many caregivers are not active information seekers.
   They must engage caregivers who may not even know what questions to ask.},

Title = {Beyond stroke: Description and evaluation of an effective intervention
   to support family caregivers of stroke patients},

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the strengths and
   weaknesses of a group support program and a home visiting program for
   family caregivers of stroke patients. It also examined the best fit
   between intervention variant and family caregiver and patient
   characteristics. van den Heuvel's previous effect study showed positive
   effects of the same intervention program, but unlike our present study
   differences between the two support variants could not be measured.
   Methods: Of 257 family caregivers who were included and randomly
   assigned to an intervention variant or a control group, 127 family
   caregivers completed the intervention in either the group program or the
   home visiting program.
   Results: Evaluation data showed that both intervention variants had been
   helpful and feasible, but home visit participants missed peer contact
   and follow-up contacts were missed in both intervention programs. In
   comparison to the home visiting program, the group program participants
   showed more benefit especially with respect to informational and
   emotional components. Caregivers' preference for type of intervention
   revealed that both types of intervention had its supporters. Those that
   preferred the group program could be clearly characterised: they were
   burdened, lived with a more psychologically handicapped relative, were
   using active coping strategies more frequently or lived in a region
   which is considered to be more sociable.
   Conclusion: The present study adds extensively to van den Heuvel's
   effect study with respect to discriminative aspects of group and home
   intervention programs and their respective benefits for specific family
   caregiver groups.
   Practice implications: In order to suitably match an intervention type
   with specific caregiver characteristics the intervention provider should
   utilize caregiver self-selection or undertake professional screening of
   caregiver burden. Telephone contacts should be offered in addition to
   the interventions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predictors of caregiver depression and family functioning after
   perinatal stroke},
Journal = {BMC PEDIATRICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Background: Perinatal stroke is a leading cause of cerebral palsy and
   lifelong neurological morbidity. Studies on perinatal stroke outcomes
   are increasing, although examinations of its broader impact on parents
   and families have been limited. A recent study found that parents of
   children with moderate and severe outcomes have increased risk for
   psychosocial concerns, including depressive symptoms and poor family
   functioning. Other parents adapt remarkably well, but how this occurs is
   unknown. The primary aim of this study was to examine predictors of
   parent and family outcomes, namely caregiver depression and family
   functioning. The secondary aim was to explore potential mediators and
   moderators of the relationship between condition severity and parent and
   family outcomes.
   Methods: Parents were recruited from a large, population-based perinatal
   stroke research cohort, and they completed measures assessing their
   demographics, social supports, stress levels, marital quality, feelings
   of guilt and blame, psychological well-being, and family functioning.
   Bivariate analyses compared these variables. Predictor variables,
   mediators, and moderators were chosen according to the strength of their
   relationship with the outcome variables (i.e., caregiver depression and
   family functioning) and theory. Hierarchical regression, mediator, and
   moderator analyses were conducted accordingly.
   Results: A total of 103 parents participated in this study (76 mothers,
   27 fathers; mean age of 39.2 years; mean child age of 7.46 years).
   Condition severity, anxiety, social support, and blame independently
   predicted caregiver depression while condition severity, stress levels,
   and marital quality independently predicted family functioning. Blame
   regarding the cause of their child's condition also mediated the
   relationship between condition severity and caregiver depression.
   Conclusions: Adverse parental outcomes can be predicted in perinatal
   stroke populations. Moreover, anxiety and stress management techniques,
   marital support, and psychoeducation regarding the unpreventable nature
   of perinatal stroke may be utilized in the future to enhance family
   outcomes.},

Title = {Life satisfaction two-years after stroke onset: the effects of gender,
   sex occupational status, memory function and quality of life among
   stroke patients (Newsqol) and their family caregivers (Whoqol-bref) in
   Luxembourg},
Journal = {BMC NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2012},

Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Background: Life satisfaction (LS) of cerebrovascular disease survivors
   and their family caregivers may relate to socioeconomic factors,
   impaired functions, health-related quality of life (QoL), but their
   respective influences remain unclear. This study assessed, two years
   post-stroke onset, the effects of these factors on patients' LS and
   family caregivers' LS in Luxembourg.
   Methods: All stroke patients admitted to all hospitals in Luxembourg
   were identified by the `Inspection General de la Securite Sociale' using
   the only national system database for care expenditure reimbursement.
   Their diagnosis was confirmed by medical investigator. The sample
   included ninety four patients living at home having given consent (mean
   age 65.5 years) and sixty two main caregivers (mean age 59.3 years).
   Questionnaires were completed during face-to-face interviews. LS was
   assessed via European single question (range 1-10), survivors' QoL via
   Newsqol (11 dimensions), and caregivers' QoL via Whoqol-bref (4 domains)
   (range 0-100). Data were analysed using multiple regression models.
   Results: Two years after stroke onset, 44.7\% of patients suffered from
   impaired sensory function, 35.1\% from impaired motor function, and
   31.9\% from impaired memory function. Mean patient' LS was 7.1/10 (SD
   1.9). It was higher in women (+12.4) and lower among unemployed
   socioeconomically active patients (-13.1, vs. retired people). Adjusted
   for sex, occupation, impaired motor and memory functions, LS positively
   correlated with scores of Newsqol feelings, sleep, emotion, cognition
   and pain dimensions (slopes 0.20 to 0.31), but did not correlate with
   those of caregivers' Whoqol-bref domains. Family caregiver' LS was 7.2
   (SD 1.7). It was lower in those with patients suffering from impaired
   memory function (-12.8) as well as from feelings and emotion issues
   (slopes 0.22). It was associated with all caregivers' Whoqol-bref
   domains (physical health, psychological health, environment, and social
   relationships) (slopes 0.53 to 0.68).
   Conclusions: Two-year post-cerebrovascular disease patient' LS was
   associated with gender, occupation, and impaired memory function. It
   correlated with feelings, sleep, emotion, cognition, and pain issues.
   Family caregivers of patients with impaired memory function had lower
   LS. Family caregiver' LS correlated with dimensions of patients'
   feelings (less independent, yourself, life changed, depressed, useless,
   less control because of stroke) and emotion (get more emotional, fear of
   another stroke or to become dependent on others), and with their own
   QoL. LS, Newsqol, and Whoqol appeared to be appropriate tools. Our
   findings may be useful for policy makers in relation to family and
   medical-social issues of stroke home-based rehabilitation.},

Title = {Measures of Psychological Stress and Physical Health in Family
   Caregivers of Stroke Survivors: A Literature Review},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Studies have demonstrated that the stress of family caregiving places
   caregivers at risk for developing depression, poor quality of life, and
   health problems. The purpose of this review was to identify the ways in
   which variables are operationalized in studies addressing psychological
   stressors and physical health of family caregivers of stroke survivors.
   The adapted Pittsburgh Mind Body Center model provides the organizing
   conceptual framework for this literature review. A literature search for
   relevant articles was conducted using Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, and Ovid
   Nursing Database for the period of July 1999 through June 2009 using the
   following search terms: caregiver (or family caregiver), stroke, stress,
   and health. Articles were included if they met the following
   inclusionary criteria: (a) written in English, (b) published in
   peer-reviewed journal, (c) focused on adults who were caring for an
   adult who experienced stroke, (d) included measures of stress and
   physical health or health-related quality of life, and (e) primarily
   used quantitative research methods. Twenty-four articles were identified
   that met the inclusion criteria. Findings related to the variables
   included in the adapted Pittsburgh Mind Body Center model are discussed.
   Variables were not well defined, a wide array of measurement instruments
   were used, and measures were taken at broadly divergent time frames
   following stroke. Future research guided by a theoretical framework,
   consistent measures of variables, and standardized measurement time
   points would allow for better comparison of findings across studies,
   thus enabling clinicians to better understand the health risks of family
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {This study developed and implemented the Transition Assistance Program
   (TAP) for stroke caregivers The program is composed of (1) skill
   development (2) education, and (3) supportive problem solving Sixty-one
   dyads (n = 122) participated thirty-nine from Puerto Rico and twenty-two
   from Texas Participants were randomly assigned to the TAP treatment or a
   control group As caregiver satisfaction with the TAP increased, strain
   and depression decreased, and caregivers reported a very high rate of
   program satisfaction (9 5 out of 10) The TAP effectively reduced
   caregiver strain at the 3-month follow-up When controlling for baseline
   differences, we found that the treatment group had lower depression (p =
   0 07) than the control group at follow-up and that the TAP may have had
   a preventative effect on depression for caregivers who had not been
   depressed at discharge, although this visual trend did not reach
   statistical significance Among veterans with low functioning at
   baseline, veterans whose caregivers had received the TAP improved in
   functioning more than did veterans whose caregivers had been in the
   control group, although this visual trend was not significant
   Functioning in veterans with stroke was also significantly linked to
   caregiver satisfaction with the TAP The findings from the current study
   warrant further evaluation of the TAP intervention},

Abstract = {Background: The majority of stroke patients are discharged home
   dependent on informal caregivers, usually family members, to provide
   assistance with activities of daily living (ADL), including bathing,
   dressing and toileting. Many caregivers feel unprepared for this role
   and this may have a detrimental effect on both the patient and
   caregiver.
   Objective: To evaluate whether or not a structured, competency-based
   training programme for caregivers {[}the London Stroke Carer Training
   Course (LSCTC)] improved physical and psychological outcomes for
   patients and their caregivers after disabling stroke, and to determine
   if such a training programme is cost-effective.
   Design: A pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial.
   Setting: Stratified randomisation of 36 stroke rehabilitation units
   (SRUs) to the intervention or control group by geographical region and
   quality of care.
   Participants: A total of 930 stroke patient and caregiver dyads were
   recruited. Patients were eligible if they had a confirmed diagnosis of
   stroke, were medically stable, were likely to return home with residual
   disability at the time of discharge and had a caregiver available,
   willing and able to provide support after discharge. The caregiver was
   defined as the main person - other than health, social or voluntary care
   provider - helping with ADL and/or advocating on behalf of the patient.
   Intervention: The intervention (the LSCTC) comprised a number of
   caregiver training sessions and competency assessment delivered by SRU
   staff while the patient was in the SRU and one recommended follow-up
   session after discharge. The control group continued to provide usual
   care according to national guidelines. Recruitment was completed by
   independent researchers and participants were unaware of the SRUs'
   allocation.
   Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were self-reported extended
   ADL for the patient and caregiver burden measured at 6 months after
   recruitment. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, mood and
   cost-effectiveness, with final follow-up at 12 months.
   Results: No differences in primary outcomes were found between the
   groups at 6 months. Adjusted mean differences were -0.2 points {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI) -3.0 to 2.5 points; p=0.866; intracluster
   correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.027] for the patient Nottingham Extended
   Activities of Daily Living score and 0.5 points (95\% CI -1.7 to 2.7
   points; p=0.660; ICC=0.013) for the Caregiver Burden Scale. Furthermore,
   no differences were detected in any of the secondary outcomes.
   Intervention compliance varied across the units. Half of the
   participating centres had a compliance rating of >60\%. Analysis showed
   no evidence of higher levels of patient independence or lower levels of
   caregiver burden in the SRUs with better levels of intervention
   compliance. The economic evaluation suggests that from a patient and
   caregiver perspective, health and social care costs, societal costs and
   outcomes are similar for the intervention and control groups at 6
   months, 12 months and over 1 year.
   Conclusions: We have conducted a robust multicentre, cluster randomised
   trial, demonstrating for the first time that this methodology is
   feasible in stroke rehabilitation research. There was no difference
   between the LSCTC and usual care with respect to improving stroke
   patients' recovery, reducing caregivers' burden, or improving other
   physical and psychological outcomes, nor was it cost-effective compared
   with usual care. Compliance with the intervention varied, but analysis
   indicated that a dose effect was unlikely. It is possible that the
   immediate post-stroke period may not be the ideal time for the delivery
   of structured training. The intervention approach might be more relevant
   if delivered after discharge by community-based teams.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Stroke causes significant caregiver (CG) stress,
   which is under-reported in India. This study assesses the financial,
   physical, psychological, and family burden on CG of stroke patients in
   an urban community.
   Methods-Cross-sectional survey of stroke patients and CG were selected
   from a community-based registry using validated scales through
   face-to-face interviews.
   Results-Data were available from 199 stroke survivors and a similar
   number of CG. Increased workload, related anxiety and depression, and
   sleep disturbance were reported by 70\%, 76\%, and 43\% of CG,
   respectively, whereas >80\% reported financial worry, which was greater
   among slum dwellers and less educated families. CG of patients with
   dementia and depression experienced greater stress. Female CG received
   more appreciation and family bonding was well-maintained.
   Conclusions-Financial stress was prominent and common among the
   socioeconomically weaker section. Psychological stress is similar to
   that of other studies. Women CG received greater appreciation. Family
   bonding was well-preserved in contrast to that of a western report.

Abstract = {Aims and objectives. This study examines the physical and emotional
   burden experienced by caregivers of stroke survivors, compared with
   caregivers of patients having neurological diseases.
   Background. Stroke survivors have residual neurological impairment,
   which requires long-term support and care. Anxiety, depression and poor
   physical health are common sequelae among family caregivers of stroke
   survivors. There is a reasonably consistent association between
   patients' levels of disability and emotional state and the emotional
   distress of their caregivers.
   Design. A convenience sample of 47 families was recruited: of the 47
   families, 23 had a member who suffered from stroke and 24 had a member
   with neurological disease.
   Method. Two interviews were conducted at three and six months after the
   occurrence of the index stroke or neurological disease.
   Results. When the two groups of caregivers were compared for anxiety,
   depression and physical health status after care giving, the caregivers
   of stroke patients demonstrated higher levels of anxiety and depression
   than their counterparts in the neurological disease group (p < 0.001).
   However, there was no significant difference in physical health status
   between the two groups. Educational attainment, patient group and
   physical and cognitive impairment of the patients were the predictors of
   anxiety and the depressive status of the caregivers, while their age and
   level of depression contributed significantly to their physical health
   status.
   Conclusion. The physical and emotional well-being of two groups of
   family caregivers in a neurosurgical unit were compared in the caring
   context. The caregivers of stroke survivors are at a greater risk of
   developing poor physical and emotional health than the caregivers of
   patients having neurological diseases.
   Relevance to clinical practice. The results illustrated that enhanced
   discharge planning and nurse follow-up sessions are considered essential
   in maintaining the well-being of the stroke caregivers and bridging the
   gap between the hospital and the community.},

Abstract = {Background/ObjectiveChronic emotional distress (e.g., depression,
   anxiety, post-traumatic stress) is common after stroke and
   interdependent between patients and their informal caregivers. We
   measured stroke survivors', caregivers', and neurocritical care nurses'
   views of primary drivers of distress during the stroke experience, and
   needs and preferences for the structure, topics, mode of delivery, and
   timing of an intervention to promote emotional recovery.MethodsWe
   conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 patient-caregiver dyads
   within the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU). Additionally,
   we conducted two focus groups with 15 nurses. Interviews and focus
   groups were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using NVivo 11 (QSR
   International) software.Results and ConclusionsThe challenges and
   impacts of stroke most commonly reported by dyads were: uncertainty
   about future health, fear of recurrent strokes, negative emotions, and
   role changes post-stroke. Dyads and nurses agreed that resiliency skills
   such as mindfulness/focusing on the present, problem solving,
   gratitude/optimism, self-care, interpersonal communication and
   developing a supportive team of family, friends, and medical staff are
   beneficial to optimize recovery. The potential barrier to intervention
   delivery was accessibility, due to challenges of time and travel to
   appointments. Participants agreed that starting the intervention at
   hospitalization and continuing via live video after discharge is an
   ideal delivery modality. Stroke survivors, caregivers, and Neuro-ICU
   nurses believe that a resiliency skills-based intervention to prevent
   chronic emotional distress is necessary and urgent. This qualitative
   study provides valuable information on the challenges faced by dyads,
   intervention topics to prioritize, and strategies to maximize
   feasibility, acceptability, and effect.},

Title = {Participant and caregiver experience of the Nintendo Wii Sports (TM)

Abstract = {Objective: To understand stroke survivors and their caregivers'
   experience and acceptability of using the Nintendo Wii Sports (TM) games
   (Wii (TM)) as a home-based arm rehabilitation tool.
   Design: A qualitative study within a randomized controlled trial
   investigating the effectiveness of using the Wii (TM) for arm
   rehabilitation. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Settings: Participants and carers were interviewed in their homes.
   Subjects: Eleven male and seven female participants and 10 caregivers
   who were taking part in the randomized controlled trial within six
   months of stroke. Median age 65.
   Intervention: All participants were using the Wii (TM) for arm
   rehabilitation.
   Main Measures: Semi-structured interviews.
   Results: Five themes were identified: diligence of play, perceived
   effectiveness, acceptability, caregiver and social support, and the
   set-up and administration of the Wii (TM). Participants appreciated the
   ability to maintain a social role and manage other comorbidities around
   the use of the Wii (TM). A small number of participants found the Mii
   characters too childlike for adult rehabilitation. The most popular game
   to start the rehabilitation programme was bowling. As confidence grew,
   tennis was the most popular, with baseball and boxing being the least
   popular games. Caregivers provided some practical support and
   encouragement to play the Wii (TM).
   Conclusions: The Wii (TM) may provide an engaging and flexible form of
   rehabilitation with relatively high reported usage rates in a home
   setting. The Wii (TM) was acceptable to this sample of patients and
   their caregivers in home-based rehabilitation of the arm following
   stroke.},

Title = {What Makes Family Caregivers Happy During the First 2 Years Post Stroke?},
Journal = {STROKE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {1084-1089},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose This study aimed to identify aspects of the
   caregiving situation contributing to family caregivers' psychological
   well-being.
   Methods Longitudinal cohort study with structured quantitative
   interviews 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post stroke. A subset of participants
   also completed surveys 18 and 24 months post stroke. Participants
   included individuals hospitalized for their first stroke and their
   family caregivers. Psychological well-being was assessed by the Positive
   Affect Scale.
   Results A total of 399 stroke survivor, caregiver dyads completed the
   1-year follow-up and 80 dyads completed the second year of follow-up.
   Using mixed effects modeling for longitudinal data, caregivers reported
   more psychological well-being when they provided more assistance to
   stroke survivors who had fewer symptoms of depression, better cognitive
   functioning, and who had more severe strokes. In addition, caregivers
   who maintained participation in valued activities had more mastery,
   gained personally providing care, were in better physical health, were
   older, and were from Quebec reported more psychological well-being.
   Caregivers followed for a second year post stroke reported better
   psychological well-being when caring for stroke survivors with fewer
   symptoms of depression and more severe strokes and when the caregivers
   had a greater sense of mastery and gained more personally providing
   care.
   Conclusions Our findings contribute to the caregiver intervention
   development literature by identifying aspects of the caregiving
   situation that are associated with positive outcomes. Incorporating
   specific aspects, for example, strategies to enhance caregiver mastery
   into programs and services offered to caregivers may enhance their
   positive experiences with providing care and ultimately enhance the
   sustainability of the caregiving situation.},

Abstract = {To examine the effects of caregiver's burden, depression, and support on
   post-stroke depression (PSD), cross-sectional data were obtained from an
   epidemiologic survey of 225 stroke survivors and their caregivers living
   in Seoul, Korea. Multivariate analyses showed that, taking the clinical
   status of patients into account, caregiver's burden, depression and
   support were related to higher PSD. Perceived burden exerts adverse
   effects on PSD through its influence on the depression in caregivers.
   Hence, the care of stroke survivors that incorporates the care of
   caregivers is likely to reduce the risk of post-stroke depression in
   patients. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {145-153},
Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Four outcome measures of carer stress and coping
   at one year post-stroke were identified: carer general health, anxiety,
   depression and perception of stress. Methods: Each outcome was assessed
   using valid and reliable instruments. In addition, we collected
   demographic data from both carers and patients which could reasonably be
   expected to influence carer stress and coping (e.g. age, deprivation
   levels) as well as information specific to the caring role. Results:
   Carers were found to be more anxious than previously reported. Neither
   satisfaction with caring nor the adoption of helpful coping strategies
   were associated with positive carer outcomes but, nevertheless, carers
   were not reluctant to care. The SF-36 is a useful predictor of carer
   stress, in particular the vitality score. Conclusions: Patient data are
   not sufficient to predict carer general health at one year. At one year,
   both patients and carers are more anxious than depressed. And there may
   be a group of patients and carers who can be characterised as borderline
   anxious and/or depressed and who warrant specific attention to prevent
   carer burnout. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose- Stroke disability is a major health burden in
   rural China where rehabilitation services are inadequate. We aimed to
   determine the effectiveness of a novel nurse-led, caregiver-delivered
   model of stroke rehabilitation in rural China. Methods- A multicenter
   prospective, randomized open, blinded outcome assessed, controlled trial
   was conducted in 3 rural county hospitals in China: Zhangwu, Liaoning
   Province (Northeast); Qingtongxia, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
   (Northwest); and Dianjiang, Chongqing Municipality (Southwest). Adult
   patients (age 18-79 years) with residual disability (Barthel Index score
   <= 80/100) after a recent acute stroke were randomized to a new service
   model or usual care. The new intervention was multifaceted and was based
   on a task-shifting / training-the-trainers model, supported by a
   custom-designed smartphone application, where patients and caregivers
   received evidence-based in-hospital education and stroke rehabilitation
   training (focus on mobility, self-care, and toileting), delivered by
   trained nurses before hospital discharge, and 3 postdischarge support
   telephone calls. Outcome assessments were undertaken before hospital
   discharge and at 3 and 6 months. Primary outcome was physical
   functioning (Barthel Index scores) at 6 months, assessed by research
   staff blind to treatment allocation, adjusted for baseline covariates in
   an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included measures of
   mobility, health-related quality of life, mood, and caregiver burden.
   The study included a process evaluation that assessed intervention
   fidelity. Results- From November 2014 to December 2016, 246 stroke
   patients were randomized to intervention (n=118) or control (n=128)
   groups. There was no statistically significant difference in adjusted
   6-month Barthel Index scores between groups (70.1 versus 74.1, mean
   difference, -4.0 {[}95\% CI, -10.0 to 2.9]), nor any differences across
   the other outcome measures. Process evaluation interviews revealed that
   the intervention was desirable and positively accepted by nurses,
   caregivers, and patients but was considered too complex despite efforts
   to simplify materials for the rural context. Key strategies identified
   for future studies included the use of community health workers,
   smartphone application enhancement, and simpler and more frequent
   training for nurses, caregivers, and patients. Conclusions- A novel
   nurse-led, digital supported, caregiver-delivered stroke rehabilitation
   program did not improve patient physical functioning after stroke in
   rural China. Further stroke rehabilitation research suitable for
   resource-poor settings is required, with several components being
   suggested through stakeholder interviews in our study.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a chronic disease responsible for changes in the
   functional capacity of the patients. Patient care is usually provided by
   family caregivers, but with great burden and negative impact on their
   quality of life.
   Objectives: (1) To investigate whether a correlation existed between the
   levels of independence and cognition in stroke patients and the burden
   and quality of life of their caregivers; (2) to assess whether periods
   of injury, rehabilitation and care, and age of the stroke patients
   interfered with these correlations.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional and correlational study that
   included 60 participants, of which 30 were post-stroke patients and 30
   were their caregivers. The data collection instruments were the Mini
   Mental State Examination and the Functional Independence Measure for the
   post-stroke participants, and the Zarit Burden Interview Scale and the
   World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, for the caregivers. The
   Pearson's product-moment correlation was used for the data analysis.
   Results: Independence and cognition showed no correlation with the
   burden and quality of life of the caregivers. We identified a strong
   positive correlation between independence and cognition (r = 0.882), and
   a moderate negative correlation between independence and rehabilitation
   period (r = -0.398) and between burden and quality of life of the
   caregivers (r = -0.414).
   Conclusions: Our data suggest the need for health interventions aimed
   not only at stroke patients, but also at their family caregivers, given
   the association between the burden and the low levels of quality of life
   of the caregivers.},

Abstract = {BackgroundInformal caregivers are vital to the long-term care and
   rehabilitation of stroke survivors worldwide. However, caregiving has
   been associated with negative psychological outcomes such as anxiety and
   depression, which leads to concerns about caregiver as well as stroke
   survivor well-being. Furthermore, caregivers may not receive the support
   and service provision they require from the hospitals and community.
   AimsThis study examines caregiver psychological well-being and
   satisfaction with service provision in the context of stroke.
   MethodsCaregiver data were collected as part of the ASPIRE-S study, a
   prospective study of secondary prevention and rehabilitation which
   assessed stroke patients and their carers at six-months post stroke.
   Carer assessment included measurement of demographics, satisfaction with
   care (UK Healthcare Commission National Patient Survey of Stroke Care),
   psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and
   vulnerability (Vulnerable Elders Scale). Logistic regression analyses
   and chi-squared tests were performed using stata version 12.
   ResultsAnalyses from 162 carers showed substantial levels of
   dissatisfaction (379\%) with community and hospital services, as well as
   notable levels of anxiety (313\%) and depressive symptoms (188\%) among
   caregivers. Caregiver anxiety was predicted by stroke survivor anxiety
   (OR=347, 95\% CI 135-893), depression (OR=517, 95\% CI 183-1458), and
   stroke survivor cognitive impairment (OR 235, 95\% CI 100-531).
   Caregiver depression was predicted by stroke survivor anxiety (OR=441,
   95\% CI 153-1272) and stroke survivor depression (OR=691, 95\% CI
   226-2117).
   ConclusionFindings indicate that caregiver and stroke survivor
   well-being are interdependent. Thus, early interventions, including
   increased training and support programs that include caregivers, are
   likely to reduce the risk of negative emotional outcomes.},

Title = {Introducing structured caregiver training in stroke care: findings from
   the TRACS process evaluation study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the process of implementation of the modified
   London Stroke Carers Training Course (LSCTC) in the Training Caregivers
   After Stroke (TRACS) cluster randomised trial and contribute to the
   interpretation of the TRACS trial results. The LSCTC was a structured
   competency-based training programme designed to help develop the
   knowledge and skills (eg, patient handling or transfer skills) essential
   for the day-to-day management of disabled survivors of stroke. The LSCTC
   comprised 14 components, 6 were mandatory (and delivered to all) and 8
   non-mandatory, to be delivered based on individual assessment of
   caregiver need.
   Design Process evaluation using non-participant observation, documentary
   analysis and semistructured interviews.
   Participants Patients with stroke (n=38), caregivers (n=38), stroke unit
   staff (n=53).
   Settings 10 of the 36 stroke units participating in the TRACS trial in
   four English regions (Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West,
   Peninsula).
   Results Preparatory cascade training on delivery of the LSCTC did not
   reach all staff and did not lead to multidisciplinary team (MDT) wide
   understanding of, engagement with or commitment to the LSCTC. Although
   senior therapists in most intervention units observed developed
   ownership of the LSCTC, MDT working led to separation rather than
   integration of delivery of LSCTC elements. Organisational features of
   stroke units and professionals' patient-focused practices limited the
   involvement of caregivers. Caregivers were often invited to observe
   therapy or care being provided by professionals but had few
   opportunities to make sense of, or to develop knowledge and
   stroke-specific skills provided by the LSCTC. Where provided, caregiver
   training came very late in the inpatient stay. Assessment and
   development of caregiver competence was not commonly observed.
   Conclusions Contextual factors including service improvement pressures
   and staff perceptions of the necessity for and work required in
   caregiver training impacted negatively on implementation of the
   caregiver training intervention. Structured caregiver training
   programmes such as the LSCTC are unlikely to be practical in settings
   with short inpatient stays. Stroke units where early supported discharge
   is in place potentially offer a more effective vehicle for introducing
   competency based caregiver training.

Title = {Changing needs of Chinese family caregivers of stroke survivors},

Abstract = {Aim. To examine the changing needs of Chinese family caregivers before
   and after stroke survivors' discharge from hospital.
   Background. Stroke ranks third as the most common cause of death in Hong
   Kong and is the leading cause of adult disability. Community care has
   been adopted as the major source of care for older people in Hong Kong
   and this has impacted on family caregivers.
   Deign and methods. This is a descriptive-correlational design using a
   within-subjects design. The needs of 40 Chinese family caregivers who
   met the inclusion criteria were assessed before discharge and two weeks
   later using the Carer Assessment Scale, Cost of Care Index and one
   open-ended question. Modified Barthel Index measured the functional
   ability of stroke survivors.
   Results. Family caregivers are able to anticipate most of their needs
   and to make provision to meet the basic practical needs before
   discharge. Although needs changed after discharge the four most
   important needs persisted. These were associated with emotional and
   psychological problems and financial difficulties. Discharge
   destinations made no difference to the total scores obtained using the
   above scales.
   Conclusions. This study provides information about need at a time of
   transition in an under-researched population of Chinese caregivers.
   Assessment of need is important with Chinese family carers in order to
   identify focused interventions in a population, i.e. reluctant to make
   their needs known to professional services. More research about
   caregiving problems for Chinese family caregivers at the transition from
   hospital to community is required.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Ongoing need assessment by nurses who
   are in regular contact with caregivers in hospital and community will
   enable appropriate interventions such as providing education and
   emotional support both before and after discharge to be offered to
   Chinese communities.},

Abstract = {Background and Objective: Despite stroke being the most common form of
   cerebrovascular disease, there has been relatively little attention paid
   to the psychosocial experiences and needs of Australian caregivers of
   people who have had a stroke. Methods: Twenty Australian informal
   caregivers and 10 stroke survivors participated in individual
   semi-structured qualitative interviews covering all aspects of
   caregiving, including stroke survivors' views on their caregiver's
   experiences. Results: The 5 interrelated topics most discussed were
   changes in relationships and support services, including being told to
   expect a poor outcome; caregiver attributes and coping strategies;
   stroke survivor limitations; external employment and financial
   stressors; and unexpected positive changes in relationships and
   priorities. Caring for a stroke survivor involves a complex interaction
   of these factors that appear to be moderated by the quality of the
   pre-existing stroke survivor caregiver relationship and the poststroke
   coping strategies used. Conclusions: Particular attention should be paid
   to how prognosis is conveyed and whether appropriate outpatient services
   are available. Clinicians should also consider discussing appropriate
   caregiver coping strategies and the quality of the relationship between
   the stroke survivor and caregiver.},

Abstract = {Purpose We sought to identify indicators associated with the quality of
   life (QoL) of stroke patients and caregivers.
   Methods The cross-sectional study was conducted at nine Dutch stroke
   service facilities involving 251 stroke patients and their caregivers.
   We used the EuroQol (EQ-5D) and Satisfaction with Stroke Care
   questionnaires, and included the variables (1) disability at hospital
   admission, (2) length of hospital stay, (3) demographic data, and (4)
   caregivers' relationship with stroke patients. The Actor-Partner
   (patient-caregiver) Interdependence Model (APIM) was used to examine
   dependence between patients' and caregivers' QoL scores through dyad
   membership.
   Results Patients' age was significantly related to their QoL, and
   caregivers' age and educational level were significantly related to
   their QoL. Patients' disability on hospital admission and length of stay
   were associated with patients' QoL, and their disability on admission
   was related to caregivers' QoL. No relationship was found between length
   of stay and caregivers' QoL. Satisfaction with care was associated with
   both patients' and caregivers' QoL.
   Conclusions The APIM distinguished the different roles of patients and
   caregivers while acknowledging the interdependence of their QoL scores.
   Satisfaction with care was identified as important indicator of stroke
   patients' and caregivers' QoL.},

Title = {Caregiver burden after stroke: towards a structural model},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: Stroke may impose a severe burden on both the
   patients and their caregivers. Although there is substantial literature
   relating to the adverse impact of stroke on patients, considerably less
   is known about its impact on their caregivers. The aim of this study was
   to analyse predictive factors of the overall burden in caregivers of
   stroke victims and to verify the structural model of burden, built on
   the basis of theoretical and empirical assumptions.
   Material and methods: One hundred and fifty pairs of patients and their
   caregivers were evaluated. The Caregiver Burden Scale (CB), Hospital
   Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC),
   Social Support Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Barthel Index and
   Scandinavian Stroke Scale were all used to evaluate caregiver burden and
   the characteristics of patients and caregivers.
   Results: The caregivers experienced a moderate burden (mean CB = 2.08)
   and emotional distress (mean total HADS = 14.1). Path analysis showed
   that higher burden was associated with a lower SOC score, higher
   emotional distress, and lower patient's functional status. Higher
   emotional distress, in turn, was associated with lower SOC and lower
   patient's functional status. These results show that the burden and the
   degree of emotional disturbance are two distinct negative consequences
   of caregiving.
   Conclusions: The negative consequences of caregiving depend mainly on
   the caregiver's intra-psychic factors and the patient's disability.
   Professional interventions should be targeted at enhancing caregivers'
   ability to cope with stress, improving their caregiving skills and
   reducing the physical dependence of patients.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Supportive Educative Learning programme on the level of
   strain experienced by caregivers of stroke patients in Thailand},

Abstract = {In Thailand, the crude death rate from stroke is 10.9/100 000 population
   and increasing. Unlike Western countries where community rehabilitation
   programmes have been established to provide services following the acute
   stage of stroke recovery, there is no stroke rehabilitation team in the
   community in Thailand. Therefore, family caregivers are the primary
   source for ongoing care and support. While family members accompany
   patients during their hospitalisation, they receive little information
   about how to assist their relatives, and as a result feel inadequately
   trained, poorly informed and dissatisfied with the support that is
   available after discharge. Family caregivers report that they suffer
   both physically and psychologically and find themselves overwhelmed with
   strain, experiencing burden and exhaustion. This study aimed to develop
   and implement a nurse-led Supportive Educative Learning programme for
   family caregivers (SELF) of stroke survivors in Thailand and to evaluate
   the effect of the SELF programme on family caregiver's strain and
   quality of life. This was a non-randomised comparative study with
   concurrent controls, using a two-group pre-test and post-test design. A
   total of 140 stroke survivors and 140 family caregivers were recruited;
   70 patients/caregiver pair in each group. Caregivers of patients
   admitted to the intervention hospital following an acute stroke received
   the intervention, while caregivers of patients admitted to the
   comparison hospital received the usual care provided at the hospital.
   The data were collected prior to discharge of the patients and after 3
   months. The family caregivers in the intervention group had a
   significantly better quality of life than the comparison group (GHQ-28
   at discharge t = 2.82, d.f. = 138, P = 0.006; and at 3 months t = 6.80,
   d.f. = 135, P < 0.001) and they also reported less strain ( Caregiver
   Strain Index at discharge t = 6.73, d.f. = 138, P < 0.001; and at 3
   months t = 7.67, d.f. = 135, P < 0.001). This research demonstrated that
   providing education and support to the family caregiver of stroke
   survivors can reduce caregiver strain and enhance their quality of life.},

Abstract = {Objective: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the
   United States. Family caregivers are susceptible to negative outcomes as
   a result of their caregiving role. A stress process model was utilized
   to identify characteristics of stroke caregivers who are at risk for
   poor physical and mental health-related quality of life (QOL). Research
   Method: Individuals who experienced an incident stroke event within the
   previous year were identified from a larger epidemiologic study of
   stroke incidence. These stroke survivors were enrolled in the Caring for
   Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke (CARES) study along with
   their primary family caregivers (N = 146 dyads). Caregivers completed a
   baseline telephone interview that assessed physical and mental
   health-related QOL, problems their family members were experiencing,
   appraisals of those problems, and caregiver resources. Results:
   Objective stressors, appraisals, and caregiver resources were related to
   caregiver physical and mental health-related QOL, ps <.05. Objective
   stressors were found to have a stronger association with caregiver
   mental health than physical health. Hierarchical regression models
   showed the relative importance of each category of predictors. In the
   final models, older age and receiving more support were associated with
   worse physical health-related QOL whereas African American race and
   fewer stroke survivor problems were associated with better mental
   health. Conclusions: The correlates of health-related QOL identified in
   this national sample of caregivers can help identify stroke caregivers
   who are at risk for poor adjustment to the caregiving role and aid in
   identifying areas that can potentially be intervened upon for these
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {Objective: Stroke does not only affect the physical state of patients
   but also the emotional state of their relatives, most effectively their
   caregivers. The study aims to examine the mood of caregivers experienced
   with care for patients with stroke who are highly dependent on the
   assistance and also to establish the relationship between the emotional
   state of caregivers and the severity of disability of the patients.
   Methods: This study contained a total of 76 patients with sufficient
   cognitive functions and severe physical disabilities with hemiplegia
   caused by a cerebrovascular accident and their caregivers and 94
   controls. The functional state of patients was assessed by the Barthel
   Index (BI). Furthermore, emotional state of the caregivers was assessed
   by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and their life
   quality was assessed by the SF36 Health Survey.
   Results: The mean anxiety (9.73 +/- 4.88) and depression rates (9.81 +/-
   5.05) in the caregivers were significantly higher than those in controls
   (p<0.001, respectively). Significant impairments were observed in both
   their mental and physical health. Regression analysis also showed a
   significant negative correlation between the BI scores and the HADS
   scores.
   Conclusion: Caregivers had an impaired emotional state and the level of
   their anxiety was associated with the severity of functional disability
   of the patients. Therefore, the support provided to the caregiver might
   be influential on the functional recovery of the patients.},

Abstract = {rehabilitation has concentrated on patient- focused intervention, which
   has reduced the level of disabilities and has increased the number of
   stroke survivors being managed at home by caregivers. This study was
   aimed at determining the level of strain experienced by the caregivers
   of stroke survivors and the quality of life (QoL) of these caregivers.
   The QoL and caregiving burden among informal caregivers of stroke
   survivors seen at the physiotherapy outpatient clinic of two hospitals
   in south- western Nigeria were documented. Participants completed the
   Personal Wellbeing index for QoL measurement and Modified Caregivers
   Strain Index for measurement of Caregivers Burden Score. A total of 130
   informal caregivers of stroke survivors participated in this study. The
   mean age of caregivers was 41.1 + 14.0 years, while that of stroke
   survivors was 60.4 + 10.9 years. Among the stroke survivors, 75 (57.8\%)
   were female, whereas 74 (56.9\%) of the caregivers were males. The
   results showed that caregivers' burden was inversely correlated to their
   QoL (p < 0.001). The lower functional status of the stroke survivors, as
   recorded by modified Rankin score and Barthel Index, was significantly
   associated with lower QoL and higher caregiver strain index of the
   caregivers. (C) 2013, Hong Kong Physiotherapy Association Ltd. Published

Abstract = {Objective: To examine characteristics that best predict family
   caregivers of stroke survivors at risk for depression. Survivor and
   caregiver demographic variables and caregiver general health,
   problem-solving skills, social support, satisfaction with rehabilitation
   health care services, preparedness, and burden were examined. Design: A
   correlational design. Participants: Seventy-four family caregivers of
   individuals receiving inpatient stroke rehabilitation were interviewed
   1-2 days prior to their relative's discharge. Main Outcome Measure: The
   Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (L. S. Radloff, 1977).
   Results: Caregivers at risk for depression had a negative orientation
   toward solving problems, a lack of caregiver preparedness, and impaired
   social functioning secondary to their own health. Conclusions:
   Rehabilitation psychologists should be aware that these variables are
   important in predicting family caregivers of stroke survivors at risk
   for depression.},

Title = {Quality of life of stroke survivors and their informal caregivers: A
   prospective study},

Abstract = {Background: Health care improvements have led to increased survival
   among stroke patients; however, the disability level remains high. These
   patients require assistance from caregivers, particularly in the first
   year after stroke. Longitudinal studies of quality of life (QoL) and the
   factors associated with QoL for both patients and caregivers are
   limited.
   Objectives: To describe the changes in QoL and determine the factors
   associated with QoL for both stroke patients and their informal
   caregivers in the first year after stroke.
   Methods: This multicenter prospective study was conducted in public
   hospitals in Mongolia. In this study, 155 first-time stroke patients and
   their 88 informal caregivers were followed up for 1 year. The
   WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was used to assess QoL. The Barthel Index was
   administered to the patients at the baseline and after 1 year. A
   generalized estimating equation analysis was used to determine the
   factors associated with QoL.
   Results: The QoL of stroke patients in the domains of physical and
   environmental aspects improved significantly (p < 0.05) after 1 year;
   however, social relationship and psychological health declined, but the
   decline was not significant. Among caregivers, psychological health and
   social relationship domains improved significantly. Factors associated
   with low QoL among stroke patients were advancing age, male patients,
   being single and less improvements on BI score, and among caregivers
   were poor physical health and financial difficulties.
   Conclusions: Efficient rehabilitation therapy for poststroke patients
   can improve their QoL. Disability training and financial support for
   caregivers of poststroke patients might be helpful; however, further
   research is required. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The modifying role of caregiver burden on predictors of quality of life
   of caregivers of hospitalized chronic stroke patients},

Abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden is an important predictor of quality of
   life (QoL) among caregivers of stroke patients. While caregiver burden
   and QoL might be closely related, caregiver burden seems also to be a
   potential modifier of the associations between patients' and caregivers'
   characteristics and caregivers' QoL.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
   caregiver burden in caregivers of hospitalized chronic stroke patients
   and the predictors of caregivers' QoL by level of caregiver burden.
   Methods: A total of 238 patients and their caregivers were interviewed
   using questionnaires consisting of the Zarit Burden Interview and the
   Korean-version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF.
   Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine
   the predictors of caregivers' QoL among caregivers stratified by median
   caregiver burden score (high/low).
   Results: Caregiver burden had a modifying effect on caregivers' QoL. In
   caregivers with high burden, the patient characteristics of being
   unemployed and the caregiver characteristics of poor health status,
   lower income, and being a spouse were negative predictors of caregivers'
   QoL. In caregivers with low burden, the patient characteristics of being
   hospitalized for a longer duration and the caregiver characteristics of
   poor health status were negative predictors of caregivers' QoL (all ps <
   0.05).
   Conclusions: This study found that in South Korea, more attention should
   be paid to spouses who are caring for hospitalized chronic stroke
   patients, particularly with regard to their health status and financial
   problems. Further studies are needed to examine the impact of factors
   not examined in the Korean cultural context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Towards a better understanding of readmissions after stroke: partnering
   with stroke survivors and caregivers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {1091-1100},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aims and objectivesTo describe the experience of readmission from the
   perspective of the stroke survivor and family caregiver.
   BackgroundOlder stroke survivors are at an increased risk for
   readmission with approximately 40\% being readmitted in the first year
   after stroke. Patients and their families are best positioned to provide
   information about factors associated with readmission, yet their
   perspectives have rarely been elicited.
   DesignDescriptive qualitative study.
   MethodsThis study included older stroke survivors who were readmitted to
   acute care from home in the six months following stroke, and their
   family caregivers. Participants were interviewed by telephone at
   approximately two weeks after discharge and a sub-set was also
   interviewed in person during the readmission. Interviews were
   audio-taped and content analysis was used to identify themes.
   ResultsFrom the 29 semi-structured interviews conducted with 20 stroke
   survivors and/or their caregivers, the following themes were identified:
   preparing to go home after the stroke, what to expect at home,
   complexity of medication management, support for self-care in the
   community and the influence of social factors.
   ConclusionsThis study provides the critical perspective of the stroke
   survivor and family caregiver into furthering our understanding of
   readmissions after stroke. Participants identified several areas for
   intervention including better discharge preparation and the need for
   support in the community for medication management and self-care. The
   findings suggest that interventions designed to reduce readmissions
   after stroke should be multifaceted in approach and extend across the
   continuum of care.
   Relevance to clinical practiceThe hospital level has been the focus of
   interventions to reduce preventable readmissions, but the results of
   this study suggest the importance of community-level care. The
   individual nature of each situation must be taken into account,
   including the postdischarge environment and the availability of social
   support.},

   a study designed to examine the quality of life in stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyads.
   Background. Stroke has a significant impact on the patient-caregiver
   dyad. Few studies have been guided by a specific conceptual framework
   which considers the interactions among pre-existing situations prior to
   stroke, the new situation caused by the stroke and the moderating
   effects of environmental and caregiver-related variables.
   Design. Longitudinal study.
   Methods. A sample of stroke survivor-caregiver dyads will be enrolled at
   patient discharge from rehabilitation hospitals and will be surveyed
   every 3 months for 1-year. Hypotheses generated from the conceptual
   framework will test predictors, mediators and moderators of stroke
   survivor and caregiver quality of life from the pre-existing situation
   prior to the stroke, the new situation mediation poststroke and
   situation moderators. The study is supported by a grant from the Centre
   of Excellence for Nursing Scholarship, Rome, December 2013.
   Discussion. This study seeks to identify variables in the pre-existing
   situation prior to the stroke (e.g. living condition), the new situation
   mediation poststroke (e.g. type of stroke and caregiver burden) as well
   as situation moderators (e.g. social support) that influence stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyad's quality of life across the stroke trajectory.
   Also, the study will inform clinical practice and research by
   identifying variables that are potentially modifiable and therefore
   amenable to intervention. The proposed framework will also be helpful
   for future research focused on stroke survivor-caregiver dyads.},

Title = {Are there gender, racial or relationship differences in caregiver task
   difficulty, depressive symptoms and life changes among stroke family
   caregivers?},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine differences in caregiver perceptions of task
   difficulty, depressive symptoms and life changes based on caregiver
   characteristics of gender, race and type of relationship to the person
   with stroke.
   Methods: A sample of 243 stroke caregivers (females n = 191; males n =
   52; non-African Americans n = 184; African Americans n = 59; non-spouses
   n = 127; spouses n = 116) were interviewed by telephone within 8 weeks
   of the survivor's discharge to home. Measures included the Oberst
   Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) for task difficulty, Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms and Bakas Caregiving
   Outcomes Scale (BCOS) for life changes. Three general linear models
   computed differences in OCBS, PHQ9 and OCBS scores.
   Results: Significant differences were found on the OCBS for females
   (p<0.001) and African American spouses (p<0.048); on the PHQ9 for
   females (p<0.001), non-African Americans (p = 0.047), spouses (p =
   0.003) and African-American spouses (p = 0.010); and on the BCOS for
   females (p = 0.008) and non-African Americans (p = 0.033).
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that female and non-African American
   stroke caregivers are relatively more likely to experience task
   difficulty, depressive symptoms and negative life changes as a result of
   providing care. African American spouses were also at risk. Tailoring
   interventions based on caregivers' characteristics may improve outcomes.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study examined (1) causality in the relationship between
   stroke caregiver mental health and care-recipient functioning, and (2)
   the prediction from stroke caregiver and care-recipient variables 5
   months and 11 months later. Research Method: Questionnaire, interview,
   and observational data were collected from 124 ethnically diverse stroke
   caregiver/care-recipient dyads in the homes of care recipients at 1, 6,
   and 12 months after discharge. Results: The magnitudes of the causal
   pathways between stroke caregiver mental health and care-recipient
   functioning were not significantly different. At 1 month after
   discharge, the best predictors of poor caregiver mental health 11 months
   later were care-recipient low daily functioning and caregiver low sense
   of coherence, high burden, and high depression. Conclusions: Caregiver
   mental health and care-recipient functioning may have reciprocal causal
   influence on each other, so one of the first steps in stroke
   rehabilitation may be providing counseling to the primary caregiver.
   Caregivers with high burden, a low sense of coherence, and a
   low-functioning care recipient are those most at risk for poor mental
   health outcomes.},

Abstract = {Purpose. The study purpose was to implement a stroke-specific, care
   coordination home telehealth (CCHT) programme for US veterans with
   stroke and their family caregivers. Methods. In a non-randomized open
   trial using a mixed methods design, we tested the utility of a
   stroke-specific, home telehealth programme with 18 veterans and 14
   caregivers for 14 days. Programme questions assessed physical
   impairment, depressive symptoms, and fall prevalence among veterans, and
   burden level among family caregivers. Nine veterans and six caregivers
   completed post-programme interviews exploring their experiences with
   telehealth. Results. During the 14-day trial, 55\% of the veterans
   screened positive for depression at least once, 36\% of the caregivers
   had clinically significant burden, half of the veterans and caregivers
   reported post-stroke concerns, and 90\% believed post-stroke contact
   from a care coordinator would have been helpful. In the interviews,
   seven veterans indicated they had fallen or almost fallen post-stroke.
   Themes centred on tailoring CCHT to individual needs, coordinating with
   support services, identifying safety issues, and providing information
   about stroke prevention. Conclusions. Home telehealth offers innovative
   ways to target post-stroke rehabilitation programmes to the needs and
   concerns of patients and their caregivers, and should include regular
   real-time contact between stroke patients and their healthcare
   providers.},

Title = {Barriers and facilitators to adherence to secondary stroke prevention
   medications after stroke: analysis of survivors and caregivers views
   from an online stroke forum},

Abstract = {Objective To identify barriers and facilitators of medication adherence
   in patients with stroke along with their caregivers.
   Design Qualitative thematic analysis of posts about secondary prevention
   medications, informed by Perceptions and Practicalities Approach.
   Setting Posts written by the UK stroke survivors and their family
   members taking part in the online forum of the Stroke Association,
   between 2004 and 2011.
   Participants 84 participants: 49 stroke survivors, 33 caregivers, 2 not
   stated, identified using the keywords `taking medication', `pills',
   `size', `side-effects', `routine', `blister' as well as secondary
   prevention medication terms.
   Results Perceptions reducing the motivation to adhere included dealing
   with medication side effects, questioning doctors' prescribing practices
   and negative publicity about medications, especially in regard to
   statins. Caregivers faced difficulties with ensuring medications were
   taken while respecting the patient's decisions not to take tablets. They
   struggled in their role as advocates of patient's needs with healthcare
   professionals. Not experiencing side effects, attributing importance to
   medications, positive personal experiences of taking tablets and
   obtaining modification of treatment to manage side effects were
   facilitators of adherence. Key practical barriers included difficulties
   with swallowing tablets, dealing with the burden of treatment and drug
   cost. Using medication storage devices, following routines and getting
   help with medications from caregivers were important facilitators of
   adherence.
   Conclusions An online stroke forum is a novel and valuable resource to
   investigate use of secondary prevention medications. Analysis of this
   forum highlighted significant barriers and facilitators of medication
   adherence faced by stroke survivors and their caregivers. Addressing
   perceptual and practical barriers highlighted here can inform the
   development of future interventions aimed at improving adherence to
   secondary prevention medication after stroke.},

Title = {The stroke caregiving trajectory in relation to caregiver depressive
   symptoms, burden, and intervention outcomes},
Journal = {TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {488-495},
Abstract = {Background: Caregiver depression and burden have a detrimental effect on
   stroke survivors' rehabilitation and are contributors to stroke
   survivors' hospital readmission and institutionalization. The stroke
   caregiving trajectory is unique compared to other illnesses, and the
   effect of length of caregiving on stroke caregiver outcomes is poorly
   understood. Interventions can improve caregiver outcomes, but the
   optimal timing of these interventions is unclear.
   Objectives: We sought to determine the relationship between: (1) length
   of caregiving and stroke caregiver depressive symptoms and burden, and
   (2) length of caregiving and amount of change in depressive symptoms and
   burden following the Resources and Education for Stroke Caregivers'
   Understanding and Empowerment (RESCUE) intervention - an online and
   telephone problem-solving, education, and support intervention.
   Methods: We analyzed retrospective data collected from 72 stroke
   caregivers who participated in the RESCUE intervention. Outcomes were
   caregiver depressive symptoms and burden. Data were analyzed using
   mixed-effects regression analysis.
   Results: Baseline depressive symptoms and burden were both negatively
   related to length of caregiving (p < 0.05). We found significant
   improvement in caregiver depressive symptoms and burden following an
   intervention. The interaction between changes in outcomes and length of
   caregiving was not significant for either depressive symptoms (p = 0.26)
   or burden (p = 0.10).
   Conclusions: This study contributes to the understanding of the
   relationship between length of caregiving and depression, burden, and
   intervention outcomes. Clinicians should recognize that the stroke
   caregiving trajectory can be nonlinear. Routine and repeated clinical
   assessment of caregiver well-being is needed, along with implementation
   of interventions when necessary, regardless of how much time has passed
   since the stroke.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The Mutuality Scale (MS) is composed of four theoretically
   derived factors (love, shared pleasurable activities, shared values, and
   reciprocity), but this structure has never been confirmed. Also,
   research involving the patient's perspective on the MS is limited. In
   this study, we tested the factorial structure of the MS and its
   reliability in stroke patients and caregivers.
   Design and Method: Cross-sectional, with a follow-up after 15 days for
   test-retest reliability. A total of 248 stroke patients and 163 stroke
   caregivers completed the MS. Stroke patients and their caregivers were
   enrolled in 10 rehabilitation hospitals across Italy. MS factorial
   structure was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis; internal
   consistency reliability was evaluated with Cronbach's a and model-based
   internal consistency index; test-retest reliability was evaluated with
   intraclass correlation coefficient.
   Results: Confirmatory factor analysis supported the four-factor
   structure of MS in its patient and caregiver version (CFI = 0.94; RMSEA
   = 0.06, for both). Cronbach's as and model-based internal consistency
   index were >0.90 and intraclass correlations ranged between 0.66 and
   0.93 in MS patient and caregiver version.
   Implication: This study tested the theoretical dimensions of the MS in
   stroke patients and their caregivers. From a scientific and clinical
   point of view, an assessment of stroke patient and caregiver mutuality
   would allow dyadic approaches to data analysis and care that account for
   the nonindependence between the stroke patient and the caregiver.},

Abstract = {Purpose The study purposes were to assess the efficacy of a caregiver
   problem-solving intervention (CPSI) on stroke caregiver physical and
   psychosocial adaptation compared with a wait-list control (WLC)
   treatment, and to assess the mediation effects of coping on outcomes.
   Methods A stress and coping model guided the study design. Outcomes were
   depression, anxiety, preparedness, life changes, and family functioning.
   CPSI started during acute rehabilitation and continued 3 months
   postdischarge. Data were collected at baseline (T1), postintervention
   (T2), and 6 (T3) and 12 months postdischarge (T4). Results Of 255
   caregivers, 75\% were depressed at baseline. Repeated measures ANOVA of
   study completers (n = 121) indicated improved T2 depression, life
   change, and health (ps < .04) favoring the CPSI group. Improvements
   faded by 6 months. Although no group differences in outcomes were found
   in the intention-to-treat analysis, growth curve modeling indicated a
   difference in depression rate of change, favoring the CPSI (p = .04).
   Perceived health, threat appraisal and rational problem-solving were
   significant mediators (ps < .05). Conclusions Findings provide direction
   for future interventions to promote and sustain healthy caregiver
   adaptation.},

Abstract = {Evaluating factors that reduce stroke survivors' (SS) health-related
   quality of life (HRQOL) is important for developing interventions to
   improve HRQOL after stroke. The influence of baseline caregiver and
   family characteristics (physical health, depressive symptoms, family
   communication) on five domains of SS HRQOL (physical function,
   memory/thinking, social activities, communication, and mood) was
   examined. Data were collected on 132 SS-caregiver dyads at baseline, 4
   months, and 12 months. Baseline caregiver depressive symptoms predicted
   lower scores for SS physical function and communication at 4 months and
   social participation and mood at 12 months. Male caregiver gender was
   negatively associated with SS HRQOL (communication and mood) at 12
   months. Early intervention targeting these family characteristics,
   especially caregiver depressive symptoms, may improve survivors' HRQOL.

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to (1) delineate the sociodemographic
   profile of Israeli primary caregivers of stroke survivors; (2) examine
   the changes in caregivers' burden, physical and emotional health, social
   support network, and quality of life (QOL) during the first 6 months
   after the stroke occurrence; and (3) identify the predictors of
   caregivers' QOL for that time period. Primary caregivers (N = 140) were
   assessed at three intervals during this period: within 2 weeks after the
   stroke occurrence, in the geriatric rehabilitation ward, and at 3 and 6
   months poststroke in the community. Results of the study revealed that
   during the 6-month period, caregivers' physical health remained stable.
   After 3 months, depression levels decreased, as did the need for
   instrumental support in and outside the home. Nevertheless, satisfaction
   with informal support and family relationships decreased, as did QOL.
   Burden decreased consistently at 3- and 6-month intervals. After 6
   months, perception of health and QOL improved, whereas the other
   variables remained stable. These results indicate that overall, this
   population of caregivers adapted to their role over the 6-month period.
   At each of the three intervals, QOL was explained by the same four
   variables, although with differential weights: number of diseases,
   confidence in the support system, burden, and sharing a household with
   the survivor. The results of this study contribute to nurses' ability to
   identify caregivers at risk and develop appropriately timed
   interventions for empowering caregivers in their role fulfillment.},

Title = {Declining Patient Functioning and Caregiver Burden/Health: The Minnesota
   Stroke Survey-Quality of Life After Stroke Study},
Journal = {GERONTOLOGIST},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {573-583},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Purpose: Caregivers of stroke patients may adapt to changes in patient
   functioning over time. If adaptation occurs, then caregiver burden and
   health may be influenced more by worsening in patient functioning than
   by static levels of functioning. This study examines the relationship
   between patients' baseline and changes in functioning and caregivers'
   subjective and objective burden as well as their health. Design and
   Methods: Only stroke patients who had caregivers were included in this
   analysis (N = 356). Stroke patients In = 281) or their proxies (n = 75)
   were interviewed within 4 months of hospital discharge and patients'
   medical records were abstracted. The primary caregiver also was
   interviewed at approximately the same time as the patient or proxy (N =
   356). In all but one of the 75 proxy cases, the proxy was the. patient's
   caregiver. Binomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used.
   Results: Declining patient neurological functioning predicted greater
   objective burden and subjective burden relating to consequences for
   caregivers' personal lives, but it did not predict caregiver health.
   Implications: The impact a patient's stroke has on a caregiver's
   personal life and the number of hours spent caring for the patient
   appear to be a function of the changes of the patient's status over time
   rather than a function of a ``snapshot{''} of their functioning at
   baseline. If these results are confirmed, interventions to protect
   caregivers may be indicated for stroke patients who continue to decline
   after hospital discharge.},

Title = {Pain and depression in caregivers affected their perception of pain in
   stroke patients},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {60},
Number = {9},
Pages = {963-970},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: Informal caregivers often serve as proxy raters of
   Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) when patients cannot report on
   their own behalf. Caregiver depression has been associated with bias in
   proxy ratings, but few studies have examined the role of caregiver pain.
   The aim of this study was to determine if caregiver depressive symptoms
   and/or pain systematically affected patient-proxy agreement on patient
   HRQL after stroke.
   Study Design and Settings: Secondary data analysis of 95 stroke patients
   and their caregivers (dyads) at 6 months poststroke. Caregiver
   depressive symptoms were measured by Center for Epidemiologic Studies
   Depression Rating Scale, and pain was measured using EQ-5D. Using
   multivariate regression, we examined the effect of caregiver depressive
   symptoms and pain on patient-proxy difference scores on Health Utilities
   Index 3 (HUI3) attributes and Short Form-36 domains of vitality and
   social functioning.
   Results: Caregiver depressive symptoms and pain were associated with
   significant differences in patient-proxy scores on HUI3 pain (P < 0.05).
   Depressed caregivers underestimated pain experienced by patients, and
   caregivers with pain overestimated patient pain. Additionally, an
   interaction between caregiver depressive symptoms and pain was
   identified.
   Conclusion: Presence of pain and depressive symptoms in caregivers can
   significantly affect perceptions of pain in stroke patients. Results
   suggest that caregivers with pain and/or depression may provide more
   biased proxy assessments of pain. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Little is known about how the burden and strain of caring for stroke
   patients with or without aphasia affects primary aphasia caregivers.
   This article (a) critically examines the literature on the burden and
   strain of care experienced by caregivers of burden stroke patients and
   (b) examines the relationship between aphasia and caregiver burden and
   strain. Two literature reviews. of three databases were conducted.
   Fourteen articles (12 quantitative articles, I mixed-design article, and
   1 qualitative caregiver article) were found to comply with the study
   criteria for the first literature search. A second literature search
   focused on strain the effects of stroke survivors' aphasia on
   caregiving; none of the articles retrieved met the inclusion criteria.
   This article stroke suggests that there is a lack of research in this
   area and that several key initiatives are needed, including the
   development of an instrument with psychometric properties appropriate
   for assessing the burden and strain on caregivers of stroke patients.
   Implications for future nursing practice and research are highlighted.},

Abstract = {Background: Several studies have reported on predictors for caregiver
   burden in patients with stroke, but the magnitude of the impact of these
   variables remains unclear. The aim of the study was to determine the
   magnitude of relationship between each predictor and caregiver burden.
   Methods: Articles related to this filed were search in PUBMED, MEDLINE
   and Cochrane Library electronic database from the upset to May 2018. Of
   the 812 articles identified, 22 were included in the final analysis
   (3025 patients and 2887 caregivers). Weighted correlation coefficient
   (r-index) was computed as effect size for each predictor. Results: Of
   predictor variables of patients, the activity of daily living and
   anxiety had moderate to large effect sizes; gender, neurological
   function and depression had the small to moderate effect sizes. Of
   caregiver's predictors, depression, anxiety, and sense of coherence had
   large effect sizes; gender, daughter in law, physical health and
   employment status had small to moderate effect sizes. Conclusions: The
   most powerful predictors of caregiver burden using meta-analysis were
   identified to direct future research and evidence-based practice.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine rural Appalachian
   Kentucky stroke survivors' and caregivers' experiences of receiving
   education from health care providers with the long-term goal of
   optimizing educational interactions and interventions for an underserved
   population.
   MethodsAn interprofessional research team, representing nursing,
   occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech language pathology,
   conducted a qualitative descriptive study involving semistructured
   interviews with 13 stroke survivors and 12 caregivers. Qualitative
   content analysis included predetermined and emerging coding. This
   article presents an in-depth analysis of a subset of data from the
   coding scheme of a larger study that examined the overall experience of
   stroke for participants.
   FindingsFindings are presented within a developing model of patient and
   caregiver education constructs including providers and receivers of
   education and the content, timing, and delivery of information.
   ConclusionsUnderstanding the experience of receiving education for
   survivors and caregivers will help practitioners provide the right
   education, to the right people, at the right time, and in the right way
   to better support underserved groups. Improving patient and caregiver
   education is paramount to supporting health behavior change to optimize
   life poststroke and prevent future strokes. Our results suggest the need
   for improved access to educational providers, proactive identification
   of informational needs by providers, greater inclusion of caregivers in
   education, enhanced communication with information provision, and
   education from multiple providers using multiple delivery methods at
   multiple time points.},

Abstract = {Purpose Guided by Friedemann's framework, the purpose of this study was
   to examine the dimensions of new family caregivers emotional strain in
   caring for persons with stroke. Method Seventy-three caregivers who were
   new to that role participated in an interview every 2 weeks for a year
   as part of a NIH project. Of these caregivers, 36 participants were
   randomly assigned and had access to a Web-based intervention and its
   e-mail discussion. In this secondary data analysis, 2,148 e-mail
   discussion messages plus 2,455 narrative interview entries were used to
   examine dimensions of caregivers emotional strain. Rigorous content
   analysis was applied to these data. Results The majority of these
   caregivers were white women with an average of 55 years who cared for
   spouses. Three themes emerged from these data: (1) being worried, (2)
   running on empty, and (3) losing self. Discussion Caregivers worried
   about themselves and their care recipient, sharing feelings of being
   just plain tired. The caregivers felt that their lives were lost to
   giving care. They described in detail the emotional strain that they
   felt, as they took on new roles in caring for the person with stroke.
   Conclusion This study informs nurses about new family caregivers
   emotional strain, or incongruence in Friedemann's terms, from their
   viewpoint and provides direction for supportive education interactions.},

Abstract = {Post-stroke memory and behavior changes (MBC) are associated with
   negative outcomes for stroke survivors and caregivers. This article
   describes the types of MBC that occur most frequently and caregivers'
   responses to these behaviors. Data were obtained through in-person
   interviews and administration of questionnaires to 132 caregivers of
   first-time stroke survivors 3-9 months after stroke. MBC were measured
   with a modified version of a Memory and Behavior Problems checklist. On
   average, caregivers reported 7.7 +/- 3.6 (range 0-17) behaviors. Common
   stroke survivor MBC included appearing sad or depressed, interrupting
   the caregiver, and being restless or agitated. These MBC were
   distressing to caregivers. Caregivers may not recognize some MBC as
   potential symptoms of depression. In addition, caregiver
   misunderstanding of the amount of control survivors may have over some
   behaviors has implications for rehabilitation and caregivers' responses
   to these changes.},

Abstract = {Policies promoting home- and community-based services and disease
   management models implicitly rely on family care, still the bedrock of
   long-term and chronic care in the United States. The United Hospital
   Fund studied family caregivers of stroke and brain injury patients when
   home care cases were opened and closed and found that even with
   short-term formal services, family caregivers provided three-quarters of
   the care. Patients' mobility impairments and Medicaid eligibility were
   the main factors in determining the amount and duration of formal
   services. Between one-third and one-half of family caregivers reported
   being inadequately prepared for the case closing. At all stages, family
   caregivers expressed significant isolation, anxiety, and depression.
   Therefore, home care agency practice and public policies should provide
   better education, support, and services for family caregivers.},

Title = {Caregiver-mediated exercises with e-health support for early supported

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background and purpose
   We designed an 8-week caregiver-mediated exercise program with e-health
   support after stroke (CARE4STROKE) in addition to usual care with the
   aim to improve functional outcome and to facilitate early supported
   discharge by increasing the intensity of task specific training.
   Methods
   An observer-blinded randomized controlled trial in which 66 stroke
   patient-caregiver couples were included during inpatient rehabilitation.
   Patients allocated to the CARE4STROKE program trained an additional
   amount of 150 minutes a week with a caregiver and were compared to a
   control group that received usual care alone. Primary outcomes:
   self-reported mobility domain of the Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS) and
   length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes: motor impairment, strength,
   walking ability, balance, mobility and (Extended) Activities of Daily
   Living of patients, caregiver strain of caregivers, and mood,
   self-efficacy, fatigue and quality of life of both patients and
   caregivers. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 8 and 12 weeks after
   randomization.
   Results
   No significant between-group differences were found regarding
   SIS-mobility after 8 (beta 6.21, SD 5.16; P = 0.229) and 12 weeks (beta
   0.14, SD 2.87; P = 0.961), and LOS (P = 0.818). Significant effects in
   favor of the intervention group were found for patient's anxiety (beta
   2.01, SD 0.88; P = 0.023) and caregiver's depression (beta 2.33, SD
   0.77; P = 0.003) post intervention. Decreased anxiety in patients
   remained significant at the 12-week follow-up (beta 1.01, SD 0.40; P =
   0.009).
   Conclusions
   This proof-of concept trial did not find significant effects on both
   primary outcomes mobility and LOS as well as the secondary functional
   outcomes. Treatment contrast in terms of total exercise time may have
   been insufficient to achieve these effects. However, caregiver-mediated
   exercises showed a favorable impact on secondary outcome measures of
   mood for both patient and caregiver.},

Title = {Healthcare utilization and cost trajectories post-stroke: role of
   caregiver and stroke factors},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {BackgroundIt is essential to study post-stroke healthcare utilization
   trajectories from a stroke patient caregiver dyadic perspective to
   improve healthcare delivery, practices and eventually improve long-term
   outcomes for stroke patients. However, literature addressing this area
   is currently limited. Addressing this gap, our study described the
   trajectory of healthcare service utilization by stroke patients and
   associated costs over 1-year post-stroke and examined the association
   with caregiver identity and clinical stroke factors.MethodsPatient and
   caregiver variables were obtained from a prospective cohort, while
   healthcare data was obtained from the national claims database.
   Generalized estimating equation approach was used to get the population
   average estimates of healthcare utilization and cost trend across 4
   quarters post-stroke.ResultsFive hundred ninety-two stroke patient and
   caregiver dyads were available for current analysis. The highest
   utilization occurred in the first quarter post-stroke across all service
   types and decreased with time. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of
   hospitalization decreased by 51, 40, 11 and 1\% for patients having
   spouse, sibling, child and others as caregivers respectively when
   compared with not having a caregiver (p=0.017). Disability level
   modified the specialist outpatient clinic usage trajectory with
   increasing difference between mildly and severely disabled sub-groups
   across quarters. Stroke type and severity modified the primary care cost
   trajectory with expected cost estimates differing across second to
   fourth quarters for moderately-severe ischemic (IRR: 1.67, 1.74, 1.64;
   p=0.003), moderately-severe non-ischemic (IRR: 1.61, 3.15, 2.44;
   p=0.001) and severe non-ischemic (IRR: 2.18, 4.92, 4.77; p=0.032)
   subgroups respectively, compared to first quarter.ConclusionHighlighting
   the quarterly variations, we reported distinct utilization trajectories
   across subgroups based on clinical characteristics. Caregiver
   availability reducing hospitalization supports revisiting caregiver's
   role as potential hidden workforce, incentivizing their efforts by
   designing socially inclusive bundled payment models for post-acute
   stroke care and adopting family-centered clinical care practices.},

Abstract = {PurposeIndividuals in rural Appalachian Kentucky face health disparities
   and are at increased risk for negative health outcomes and poor quality
   of life secondary to stroke. The purpose of this study is to describe
   the experience of stroke for survivors and their caregivers in this
   region. A description of their experiences is paramount to developing
   tailored interventions and ultimately improving health care and support.
   MethodsAn interprofessional research team used a qualitative descriptive
   study design and interviewed 13 individuals with stroke and 12
   caregivers, representing 10 rural Appalachian Kentucky counties. The
   transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
   FindingsA descriptive summary of the participants' experience of stroke
   is presented within the following structure: (1) Stroke onset, (2)
   Transition through the health care continuum (including acute care,
   inpatient rehabilitation, and community-based rehabilitation), and (3)
   Reintegration into life and rural communities.
   ConclusionsThe findings provide insight for rural health care providers
   and community leaders to begin to understand the experience of stroke in
   terms of stroke onset, transition through the health care continuum,
   return to home, and community reintegration. An understanding of these
   experiences may lead to discussions of how to improve service provision,
   facilitate reintegration, support positive health outcomes, and improve
   quality of life for stroke survivors and their caregivers. The findings
   also indicate areas in need of future research including investigation
   of the effects of support groups, local health navigators to improve
   access to information and services, involvement of faith communities,
   proactive screening for management of mental health needs, and caregiver
   respite services.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the post-stroke care program within the community setting in Thailand.
   Methods: This quasi-experimental study was a nonequivalent control group
   pre-test and post-test design. A total of 62 pairs of post-stroke
   patients and their family caregivers were recruited to the study (31
   pairs per group). The intervention consisted of a four-week program that
   included distributing pertinent information, providing skill practice
   during post-stroke care sessions and utilizing strategies to enhance
   motivation and behavioral skills of family caregivers based on the
   information-motivation-behavioral skills model. The family caregivers'
   post-stroke care skills were evaluated. The patients' activities of
   daily living (ADLs) and complications were evaluated at baseline and
   immediately and 2-month post-intervention. Statistical analysis included
   chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, independent t-test, and two-way
   repeated measures' analysis of variance.
   Results: After participating in the program, family caregivers in the
   experimental group significantly improved their post-stroke care
   knowledge and skills as compared to those in the control group (F =
   585.81, p < .001). ADLs among post-stroke patients in the experimental
   group significantly increased over time and were higher than those in
   the control group (F = 46.01, p < .001). Moreover, complications among
   patients in the experimental group were less than those in the control
   group.
   Conclusions: The post-stroke care program improved family caregivers'
   post-stroke care skills which resulted in improved functional status and
   decreased complications among post-stroke patients. (C) 2017 Korean

Abstract = {Aim. To explore community-dwelling first-time stroke survivors and
   family caregivers' perceptions of being engaged in stroke
   rehabilitation.
   Background. Stroke is recognized as a worldwide common healthcare
   problem and the leading cause of adult disability. An holistic approach
   to rehabilitation can only be achieved by engaging stroke survivors and
   caregivers in all stages of recovery and by providing ongoing
   coordinated rehabilitation programmes.
   Design. An interpretive study design was applied to the study.
   Method. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 22 community-dwelling
   first-time stroke survivors and caregivers were conducted in 2013. The
   interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using a thematic
   analysis.
   Findings. Four major themes were identified. First, participants
   demonstrated low health literacy in stroke and their needs to learn
   about the disease and rehabilitation were usually ignored in busy
   clinical settings prior to discharge from hospital. Second, there was a
   lack of communication and continuity of treatment when the stroke
   survivors were transferred from one institution to another. Third,
   challenged with fragmented post-discharge rehabilitation services, the
   participants perceived that nurse-led coordination of rehabilitation was
   desirable. Fourth, participants perceived ongoing changing of
   rehabilitation goals in different stages of recovery. They expected to
   be engaged in ongoing rehabilitation planning and programmes.
   Conclusion. The findings of this study challenge service providers to
   realize a true partnership with stroke survivors and caregivers by
   working with them as one team that is led by nurses. Making the
   necessary changes requires mutual effort at both the systemic and
   individual levels with rehabilitation nurse-led coordination of
   rehabilitation programmes.},

Abstract = {Background. The purpose of this study was to analyse whether the
   parallel life situation between stroke patients and their informal
   caregivers (dyads) shown in cross-sectional studies prevails also in a
   longitudinal perspective.Methods. A total of 377 Swedish stroke
   patients, aged 65 years, and their 268 informal caregivers were followed
   from hospital admission and one year on. Analyses were based on patient
   interviews, functional ability (MMSE) score, Nottingham Health Profile
   (NHP) score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score, self-rated
   health score, and the Gothenburg Quality of Life (GQL) activity score.
   Similar information was obtained by postal questionnaires from informal
   caregivers, also including information on the nature and amount of
   assistance provided and on Caregiver Burden (CB) score.Results. Before
   index admission informal caregivers provided care on average 5 h per
   week and after discharge 11 h per week (P < 0.0001). Support volume was
   associated with patient sex (more for men), low patient's functional
   ability, low received municipal social service support, closeness of
   patient-caregiver relation, and short distance to patient's home.
   Significant positive associations within the dyads were found for HAD
   anxiety score (P < 0.0001), total NHP score (P < 0.0001), and GQL
   activity score (P < 0.0001) after adjustment for patient's age, sex,
   functional ability, and patient-caregiver relationship. CB score
   increased with amount of informal caregiver support, patient's age, and
   with low functional ability and low amount of municipal social service
   support. All these associations were constant across time.Conclusions.
   There was an association within the dyads regarding anxiety score, NHP
   score, and activity score. CB score was generally high.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Studies suggest that family caregiver well-being
   (ie, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) may affect stroke
   survivor depressive symptoms. We used mediation analysis to assess
   whether caregiver well-being might be a factor explaining stroke
   survivor depressive symptoms, after controlling for demographic factors
   and stroke survivor impairments and problems. Methods: Caregiver/stroke
   participant dyads (N = 146) completed measures of stroke survivor
   impairments and problems and depressive symptoms and caregiver
   depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Mediation analysis was used
   to examine whether caregiver well-being mediated the relationship
   between stroke survivor impairments and problems and stroke survivor
   depressive symptoms. Results: As expected, more stroke survivor problems
   and impairments were associated with higher levels of stroke survivor
   depressive symptoms (P < .0001). After controlling for demographic
   factors, we found that this relationship was partially mediated by
   caregiver life satisfaction (29.29\%) and caregiver depressive symptoms
   (32.95\%). Although these measures combined to account for 40.50\% of
   the relationship between survivor problems and impairments and
   depressive symptoms, the direct effect remained significant.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that stroke survivor impairments and
   problems may affect family caregivers and stroke survivors and a high
   level of caregiver distress may result in poorer outcomes for stroke
   survivors. Results highlight the likely importance of intervening with
   both stroke survivors and family caregivers to optimize recovery after
   stroke.},

Abstract = {Despite the prevalence of women caring for stroke survivors, relatively
   little research has focused specifically on the experience and needs of
   informal female caregivers of stroke survivors. Therefore, the purpose
   of this study was to describe the experience of female caregivers who
   care for an adult family member who has experienced a stroke within the
   previous year using a qualitative methodology. A sample of 46 female
   caregivers of stroke survivors completed a demographic form and
   responded to open-ended written questions exploring their experiences as
   caregivers and how they coped with changes in their lives during the
   first year after the stroke. Four concepts emerged from the data: losing
   the life that once was, coping with daily burdens, creating a new
   normal, and interacting with healthcare providers. Findings suggest that
   female caregivers of stroke survivors grieve the life that they once
   shared with the stroke survivor and struggle to cope with multiple
   family and work demands while trying their best to interact with
   healthcare providers to attain the best possible care for their loved
   ones. Recognizing the unique challenges of female caregivers of stroke
   survivors may help nurses provide better support and resources to meet
   their needs.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Many stroke caregivers are inadequately informed about
   stroke and its sequelae and have little preparation for the physical
   demands of moving, lifting, and handling often required. Our objectives
   are to examine the association between health education needs and
   physical injury sustained as a result of activities related to the
   caregiving role. Method: A total of 276 caregivers of veterans who
   suffered an acute stroke event were surveyed about their information
   needs and injury status. We used multi-variate logistic regression
   analysis to calculate adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios for injury
   status. Results: Results indicate that in the adjusted model, caregivers
   who had increased educational needs were almost twice as likely (OR:
   1.80; 95\% CI: 1.74-1.94) to have incurred an injury related to
   caregiving activities. Conclusions: Health education interventions that
   provide stroke caregivers with educational materials may help reduce
   caregiver injuries.},

Abstract = {Background: Limited data are available on caregiver burden for stroke
   and dementia patients. We examined the associations of prevalent stroke
   and dementia with family caregiver burden in Japanese general
   populations. Methods: A total of 916 Japanese home caregivers, whose
   family members were covered by long-term care insurance, responded to
   the caregiver burden questionnaire. The questionnaire included the
   caregiver's age, sex and employment status, the patient-caregiver
   relationship, the patient's history of stroke, symptoms of dementia,
   care levels under long-term care insurance and the Zarit Caregiver
   Burden Interview. Results: The mean total score from the Zarit Caregiver
   Burden Interview was 12\% higher in patients with stroke than in those
   without (p=0.02) and 40\% higher in those with dementia than in those
   without (p < 0.001). Compared with nonstroke patients without dementia,
   the mean total score was 21\% higher in stroke patients without dementia
   (p = 0.01), 49\% higher in nonstroke patients with dementia (p < 0.001)
   and 55\% higher in stroke patients with dementia (p < 0.001). After
   adjustment for the caregiver's age, sex and employment status, the
   patient-caregiver relationship, and the patient's care level and
   community, the higher scores remained statistically significant for
   nonstroke patients with dementia and for stroke patients with dementia
   but not for stroke patients without dementia. Conclusions: Prevalent
   stroke and, more strongly, dementia were associated with increased
   family caregiver burden. Among patients with dementia, the presence of
   stroke did not enhance caregiver burden further. Copyright (c) 2008 S.

Abstract = {Caregivers (CGs) of stroke survivors assume their role suddenly and with
   little preparation. Negative emotions are common, persist over time, and
   are related to other negative outcomes. This pilot study, guided by a
   coping model, examined the efficacy and durability of a caregiver
   problem-solving intervention (CPSI) on CG and stroke survivor outcomes.
   Additional aims included assessment offeasibility issues and reliability
   and sensitivity of the study measures. The nonrandom sample of 15 stroke
   CGs was matched on depression and demographics with a comparison group.
   The CPST started during acute rehabilitation and continued through 2
   months after discharge. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to
   assess achievement of the aims. CG depression, anxiety preparedness, and
   survivor motor function improved significantly in the intervention group
   over time, Burden, life changes, and taking care of CGs own needs did
   not change significantly. CPSI group CG depression significantly
   improved compared with the matched group. The improvement in outcomes
   for the CPSI group supports further testing of the intervention with a
   large sample.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a life-disrupting, costly event for many stroke
   patients and their families. An estimated 4.8 million stroke survivors
   are living in the community with some level of disability, and the
   incidence of stroke is expected to rise with correspondingly higher
   costs, both in dollars and other forms of burden for families of
   patients with stroke. Approximately 80,000 veterans have experienced a
   stroke, leaving approximately 40\% with moderate residual impairments
   and 15\%-30\% with severe residual disability. Purpose: The purpose of
   this study was to identify postdischarge needs of veterans with stroke
   and their caregivers and to identify how to design a care
   coordination/home-telehealth (CC/HT) program to address these needs.
   Method: Veterans and their caregivers (N = 22) were interviewed about
   their experiences with stroke, their postdischarge stroke recovery
   needs, and their experiences with the Veterans Administration's existing
   Care Coordination/ Home-Telehealth (CC/HT) program. Data were analyzed
   using the process of grounded dimensional analysis. Results: Core
   concepts identified were (a) assessing and managing the residual effects
   of stroke, and (b) shifting roles and responsibilities. Conclusion: The
   findings suggest that a comprehensive care coordination program that
   includes home telehealth could aid veterans and their caregivers in
   managing stroke recovery across the continuum of care at home and within
   the community. The results of the study can provide elements to be
   included in the CC/HT program.},

Abstract = {Goal: We utilize group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to delineate
   depressive symptom trajectories among stroke survivor-caregiver dyads,
   to identify predictors of the delineated trajectories, and to assess the
   influence of time-varying covariates (stroke survivor depressive
   symptoms and functional disability, caregiver depressive symptoms, and
   foreign domestic worker {[}FDW] assistance) on the level of the
   depressive symptom trajectories. Methods: Data on 172 stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyads in Singapore, for whom depressive symptoms were
   assessed thrice (baseline/3 months/6 months), were utilized. GBTM was
   applied to delineate depressive symptom trajectories, and to identify
   their predictors and time-varying covariates. Findings: Three stroke
   survivor depressive symptom trajectories (low and decreasing {[}47.6\%],
   low and increasing {[}43.1\%], and high and increasing {[}9.3\%]) and 2
   caregiver depressive symptom trajectories (low and stable {[}71.5\%] and
   high and decreasing {[}28.5\%]) were delineated. Caregivers with chronic
   diseases were more likely (odds ratio {[}95\% confidence interval]:
   8.09{[}2.04-32.07]) and those caring for older stroke survivors
   (0.94{[}0.90-0.98]) were less likely to follow the high and decreasing
   than the low and stable depressive symptom trajectory. An increase in
   stroke survivor functional disability and caregiver depressive symptoms
   led to a rise (similar to worsening) in stroke survivor depressive
   symptom trajectories. Whereas an increase in stroke survivor depressive
   symptoms led to a rise in caregiver depressive symptom trajectories, FDW
   assistance led to a decline (similar to improvement). Conclusion: Care
   professionals should be mindful of heterogeneity in depressive symptom
   patterns over time among stroke survivor-caregiver dyads. Reciprocal
   association of depressive symptoms in the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad
   suggests that addressing mood problems in 1 member may benefit the other
   member, and calls for dyadic mental health interventions.},

Abstract = {Background: Several systematic reviews have shown that additional
   exercise therapy has a positive effect on functional outcome after
   stroke. However, there is an urgent need for resource-efficient methods
   to augment rehabilitation services without increasing health care costs.
   Asking informal caregivers to do exercises with their loved ones,
   combined with e-health services may be a cost-effective method to
   promote early supported discharge with increased functional outcome.
   The primary aim of the CARE4STROKE study is to evaluate the effects and
   cost-effectiveness of a caregiver-mediated exercises program combined
   with e-health services after stroke in terms of self-reported mobility
   and length of stay.
   Methods: An observer-blinded randomized controlled trial, in which 66
   stroke-patients admitted to a hospital stroke unit, rehabilitation
   center or nursing home are randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of the
   CARE4STROKE program in addition to usual care (i.e., experimental group)
   or 8 weeks of usual care alone (i.e., control group). The CARE4STROKE
   program is compiled in consultation with a trained physical therapist. A
   tablet computer is used to present video-based exercises for gait and
   gait-related activities in which a caregiver acts as an exercise coach.
   Primary outcomes are the mobility domain of the Stroke Impact Scale and
   length of stay. Secondary outcomes are the other domains of the Stroke
   Impact Scale, motor impairment, strength, walking ability, balance,
   mobility, (Extended) Activities of Daily Living, psychosocial
   functioning, self-efficacy, fatigue, health-related quality of life of
   the patient as well as the experienced strain, psychosocial functioning
   and quality of life of the caregiver. An economic evaluation will be
   conducted from the societal and health care perspective.
   Discussion: The main aspects of the CARE4STROKE program are 1)
   increasing intensity of training by doing exercises with a caregiver in
   addition to usual care and 2) e-health support. We hypothesize this
   program leads to better functional outcome and early supported
   discharge, resulting in reduced costs.},

Title = {The relationship between caregiver impacts and the unmet needs of
   survivors of stroke},
Journal = {PATIENT PREFERENCE AND ADHERENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: Caregivers play a crucial role in meeting the needs of
   survivors of stroke. Yet, little is known about how they are impacted by
   their caregiving role.
   Objectives: To describe the relationship between survivor long-term
   unmet needs (. 12 months) and caregiver impacts, and identify
   characteristics that are associated with reported moderate to severe
   impacts on caregivers.
   Method: This was a cross-sectional survey using data from the Australian
   Stroke Survivor and Carer Needs Survey. Community dwelling adults 12+
   months poststroke and their caregivers participated. Caregivers and
   survivors were asked about the extent to which the domains of work,
   leisure and family, and friend and spousal relationships had been
   impacted using a Likert scale of responses. The extent to which survivor
   needs were being met was measured over the domains of health, everyday
   living, work, leisure, and finances, and the total number of unmet needs
   was calculated. The association between survivor unmet needs and
   caregiver impacts was assessed using multivariable logistic regression
   adjusted for caregiver and survivor characteristics.
   Results: Of the 738 completed survivor surveys, 369 contained matched
   caregiver data (survivors: median age, 71 years; 67\% male) (caregivers:
   median age, 64 years; 26\% male). For caregivers, the domains of work,
   leisure, and friendships were most impacted. The odds of a caregiver
   experiencing moderate to extreme impacts increased with the number of
   reported survivor unmet needs. This was greatest for spousal (aOR
   {[}adjusted odds ratio]: 1.14; 95\% CI {[}confidence interval]: 1.07,
   1.21; P<0.001) and friend relationships (aOR: 1.14; 95\% CI: 1.07, 1.21;
   P<0.001). Caring for a survivor who needed daily living assistance was
   associated with moderate to extreme caregiver impacts across all
   domains.
   Conclusion: Caregivers of survivors of stroke experience large negative
   impacts, the extent to which is associated with survivors unmet needs.
   Targeted, long-term solutions are needed to support survivors and
   caregivers living in the community.},

Title = {Employment status, social function decline and caregiver burden among
   stroke survivors. A South Indian study},

Abstract = {Stroke leaves at least 60\% of the survivors with moderate to severe
   disability limiting their employment status and social functioning
   leading to high levels of caregiver burden.
   Aim: We sought to study the employment status and level of change of
   social functioning of stroke survivors and their principal caregiver and
   correlate it with severity of stroke, functional disability, and anxiety
   and depression scores.
   Methods: One hundred and fifty stroke survivors and principal caregivers
   (3 months-2 years post-stroke) were recruited for the study. The
   employment status pre- and post-stroke was assessed. The social function
   of the patient and caregiver was analyzed using a 6 item social function
   scale developed for the study, encompassing culturally relevant
   questions. A 20 point scale adapted from Burden assessment schedule was
   used to assess the caregiver burden.
   Results: Mean age of the study group was 54.37 +/- 12.072 (range 22-75
   years), with 116 males and 34 females. Spouse was the principal
   caregiver for 142/150 patients (94.6\%). In the stroke survivors,
   compared to the pre-stroke employment status of 62.7\%, only 20.7\% were
   employed post-stroke with half having change of job. But the employment
   status of caregiver was not reduced post-stroke (34.7\% vs 33.3\%).
   Employment loss in stroke survivors had a statistically significant
   association with severity of functional disability, male gender and
   presence of limb weakness (p values 0.037, 0.0001 and 0.043
   respectively). There was an overall decline in social functions among
   the 6 parameters assessed in both the stroke survivors and caregivers.
   Of the caregiver burden, financial burden was more among female and
   older caregivers. The functional status and motor weakness of the stroke
   survivors did not tend to worsen the overall caregiver burden.
   Conclusions: Loss of occupation among stroke survivors is high. The
   decline in social function among stroke survivors and caregivers was
   significant. Even though functional disability contributed to employment
   loss and social function decline among stroke survivors, it did not have
   a significant impact on caregiver burden. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   Socio-Economic Factors, Motor Impairment, Newcastle Stroke-Specific

Abstract = {Background: Life satisfaction of stroke survivors is known to be
   associated with socio-economic factors and the survivor's and his/her
   caregiver's quality of life, but their respective influence remains to
   be fully elucidated. Purpose: To analyse the stroke survivors' life
   satisfaction 2 years after the event and its relationships with quality
   of life, socio-economic and stroke-related characteristics, and with
   informal caregivers' life satisfaction and quality of life. Methods:
   Over 18 months, all stroke patients from Luxembourg and northeastern
   Portugal who lived at home were identified from the Inspection Generale
   de la Securite Sociale and hospital records, respectively. The clinical
   diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease was confirmed. We excluded all
   patients who declared that stroke did not result in neurological
   impairments at the time of stroke from the statistical analysis. The
   samples comprised 79 patients in Luxembourg and 48 in Portugal. Patients
   and the people they identified as their main caregivers were interviewed
   using validated questionnaires measuring life satisfaction, i.e. the
   Newcastle Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (Newsqol - 11 subscales),
   which identifies the areas affected by stroke among patients, and the
   World Health Organization Quality of Life - bref (Whoqol-bref - 4
   subscales) of informal caregivers. Survivors without neurological
   impairment at the time of stroke were excluded. Data were analysed via
   multiple-regression models. Results: Life satisfaction was higher among
   women and lower among subjects with impaired motor functions. It was
   lower among Portuguese respondents with low-level education (<12th
   grade) and higher among those at work (37.6/100). In Luxembourg, retired
   people had more life satisfaction than did working people (-7.9/100).
   Controlling for socio-economic factors, life satisfaction was associated
   with feelings-Newsqol (slope 0.25) among Luxembourg residents, and with
   feelings-, mobility- and self-care-Newsqol (slopes 0.24, 0.27 and 0.33,
   respectively) among Portuguese respondents. Life satisfaction of
   patients was strongly related to that of family caregivers among the
   Portuguese respondents (slope 0.66) but the relationship was moderate in
   Luxembourg (slope 0.28). The survivors' life satisfaction was not
   correlated with any Whoqol-bref domain in the Luxembourg group, but was
   correlated with the Whoqol-bref psychological, social relationships and
   environment domains among the Portuguese respondents (slopes 0.55, 0.59
   and 0.51, respectively). Conclusions: The life satisfaction scale and
   the Newsqol stroke instrument, which identify areas of quality of life
   affected by stroke, are reliable patient-centred markers of intervention
   outcome. They can be used within the framework of medical follow-up
   (such as telephone assistance, clinical practice and prevention).
   Depending on the stroke survivor's and the family caregiver's habitual
   lifestyle and material circumstances, enhancement of a caregiver's
   quality of life can help maintain the patient's life satisfaction,
   particularly in a rural setting. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Rationale The majority of stroke patients are discharged home dependent
   on informal caregivers, usually family members, to provide assistance
   with activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, and
   toileting. Many caregivers feel unprepared for this role, and this may
   have a detrimental effect on both the patient and caregiver.
   Aims To evaluate whether a structured, competency-based training
   programme for caregivers improves physical and psychological outcomes
   for patients and their caregivers after disabling stroke, and to
   determine if such a training programme is cost-effective.
   Design A cluster randomized controlled trial. The trial aims to recruit
   25 patient and caregiver dyads from each of the 36 participating stroke
   rehabilitation units. Stroke units have been randomized to either the
   intervention or control group with randomization stratified by
   geographical region and quality of care. The intervention is the London
   Stroke Carer Training Course developed and evaluated in a previous
   single-centre study. The London Stroke Carer Training Course comprises a
   number of caregiver training sessions and competency assessment
   delivered while the patient is in the hospital and one follow-up session
   after discharge. The multidisciplinary teams in the units randomized to
   the intervention group have been trained to incorporate delivery of the
   London Stroke Carer Training Course into ward practice, while those
   randomized to the control group have continued to provide usual care
   according to national guidelines.
   Study outcomes The primary outcomes are extended activities of daily
   living for the patient and caregiver burden measured at six-months after
   recruitment. Secondary outcomes include mood and cost-effectiveness,
   with final follow-up at 12 months.},

Title = {The effects of stroke disability on spousal caregivers},
Journal = {NEUROREHABILITATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {85-92},
Abstract = {Objective: To examine the effects of unilateral stroke patients'
   neurobehavioral characteristics on spousal psychosocial function.
   participants: The sample consisted of twenty unilateral stroke patients
   and their spousal caregivers.
   Methods: Patient assessments included mood, affect perception,
   sensorimotor and cognitive function, marital satisfaction, and
   activities of daily living. Spousal assessments included mood, marital
   satisfaction, and perceived stress.
   Results: To avoid the risk of committing a type I error, the alpha-level
   of 0.05 was corrected for multiple comparisons involving the three
   outcome measures, resulting in an adjusted alpha of 0.017 (0.05/3).
   Using this criterion, the negative correlation between patient
   depression and spousal marital satisfaction was statistically
   significant (r(s) = -0.585, p = 0.007). There was also a trend for
   hemispheric side of stroke to correlate with spousal stress (r(s) =
   0.498, p = 0.025), such that strokes in the left hemisphere were
   associated with greater stress, whereas strokes in the right hemisphere
   were associated with less stress.
   Conclusion: These results show that patient depression in particular
   constitutes a risk factor for marital dissatisfaction in the first few
   months following stroke. Given that spousal partners provide a large
   portion of informal support to stroke patients, successful treatment of
   patient depression may have benefits at the level of the individual,
   family, and community.},

Abstract = {Introduction and Goal: Stroke is a serious health condition that
   disproportionally affects African-Americans relative to non-Hispanic
   whites. In the absence of clearly defined reasons for racial disparities
   in stroke recovery and subsequent stroke outcomes, a critical first step
   in mitigating poor stroke outcomes is to explore potential barriers and
   facilitators of poststroke recovery in African-American adults with
   stroke. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore
   poststroke recovery across the care continuum from the perspective of
   African-American adults with stroke, caregivers of African-American
   adults with stroke, and health care professionals with expertise in
   stroke care.
   Materials and Methods: This qualitative descriptive study included
   in-depth key informant interviews with health care providers (n = 10)
   and focus groups with persons with stroke (n = 20 persons) and their
   family members or caregivers (n = 19 persons). Data were analyzed using
   thematic analysis according to the Social Ecological Model, using both
   inductive and deductive approaches.
   Findings: Persons with stroke and their caregivers identified social
   support, resources, and knowledge as the most salient factors associated
   with stroke recovery. Perceived barriers to recovery included: (1)
   physical and cognitive deficits, mood; (2) medication issues; (3) lack
   of support and resources; (4) stigma, culture, and faith. Health care
   providers identified knowledge/information, care coordination, and
   resources in the community as key to facilitating stroke recovery
   outcomes.
   Conclusions: Key findings from this study can be incorporated into
   interventions designed to improve poststroke recovery outcomes and
   potentially reduce the current racial-ethnic disparity gap.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Health and social care services are increasingly reliant on
   informal caregivers to provide long-term support to stroke survivors.
   However, caregiving is associated with elevated levels of depression and
   anxiety in the caregiver that may also negatively impact stroke survivor
   recovery. This qualitative study aims to understand the specific
   difficulties experienced by caregivers experiencing elevated symptoms of
   anxiety and depression.
   Methods: Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   caregivers experiencing elevated levels of depression and anxiety, with
   a thematic analysis approach adopted for analysis.
   Results: Analysis revealed three main themes: Difficulties adapting to
   the caring role; Uncertainty; and Lack of support.
   Conclusions: Caregivers experienced significant difficulties adapting to
   changes and losses associated with becoming a caregiver, such as giving
   up roles and goals of importance and value. Such difficulties persisted
   into the long-term and were coupled with feelings of hopelessness and
   worry. Difficulties were further exacerbated by social isolation, lack
   of information and poor long-term health and social care support.
   Clinical Implications: A greater understanding of difficulties
   experienced by depressed and anxious caregivers may inform the
   development of psychological support targeting difficulties unique to
   the caring role. Improving caregiver mental health may also result in
   health benefits for stroke survivors themselves.},

Title = {Informal caregivers' burden and stress in caring for stroke survivors
   with spatial neglect: an exploratory mixed-method study},

Abstract = {Background: Spatial neglect prolongs stroke survivors' recovery to
   independence. However, little is known about the impact of spatial
   neglect on caregivers of stroke survivors.
   Objective: To explore the factors associated with burden and stress
   among informal caregivers of stroke survivors with spatial neglect.
   Methods: Following the previous study of 108 stroke survivors, we
   reached 24 stroke survivors' caregivers, and 20 caregivers (age: M +/-
   SD=56.9 +/- 12.7 years; 12 females) completed the study. 10 survivors
   had symptoms of spatial neglect, and 10 did not (i.e., SN+ or SN-,
   respectively) at the time when discharged from inpatient rehabilitation,
   which was 9.3 +/- 6.2 months before the present study. Via a
   semi-structured telephone interview, we assessed caregivers' burden and
   stress qualitatively and quantitatively.
   Results: No difference was observed across caregiver groups in cognitive
   function, depressive mood, or community mobility. In comparison,
   caregivers of the SN+ group allocated more time to care, controlling for
   survivors' disability (adjusted effective size d = 1.80). Their
   self-perceived burden and stress were more severe than the other group
   (adjusted d = .99). Qualitative analysis indicated caregivers of the SN+
   group were more likely to describe economic stressors and undesirable
   changes in career and vacation planning. While 80\% of participants
   preferred their care recipients to receive additional motor or mobility
   therapy, caregivers of the SN+ group were more likely to suggest
   additional therapy for cognitive impairment.
   Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that spatial neglect may
   heighten caregivers' burden and stress levels. Future studies with a
   large sample size are required.},

Abstract = {It is important to understand burden in caregivers of stroke survivors
   during the early poststroke period if we are to prevent or decrease the
   longer-term experience of caregiver burden and its consequences. This
   article reports a concept analysis of burden in caregivers of stroke
   survivors during the early poststroke period. A literature review using
   MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases
   (1960-2014) identified 32 relevant articles published from 1993 to 2013.
   Rodgers's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used. Three
   attributes-objective and subjective aspects, time spent caring for the
   stroke survivor, and uncertainty about the future for the stroke
   survivor and caregiver-were identified. Multiple definitions of
   caregiver burden have been used. In the early poststroke period, burden
   appears closely interconnected with other factors, some of which may be
   modifiable.},

Title = {Restricted Participation in Stroke Caregivers: Who Is at Risk?},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {96},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1284-1290},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective: To identify caregiver-, stroke survivor, and caregiving
   situation related factors that are associated with caregivers'
   restriction from participation in their normative activities (ie,
   participation restriction) over the first 2 years poststroke.
   Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
   Setting: Acute care facilities and community.
   Participants: A secondary data analysis of caregiver/survivor dyads
   (N=399).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Data were collected at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24
   months poststroke. The primary outcome was caregivers' participation
   restriction and was assessed using the Caregiver Impact Scale.
   Caregivers also provided demographic information and completed
   standardized measures to capture assistance provided, mastery, and
   depression. From stroke survivors we collected demographic
   characteristics, stroke severity, and cognitive and physical
   functioning. Data were analyzed using individual growth curve modeling.
   Results: Participation restriction level improved over time. Caregiver
   factors associated with restricted participation included younger age,
   being employed, higher depression, and lower mastery level. Stroke
   survivor factors associated with caregivers' restricted participation
   included hemorrhagic stroke, more severe stroke, more physical and
   memory impairments, and lower participation. Significant factors related
   to the caregiving situation included providing high levels of assistance
   and caring for a spouse.
   Conclusions: Depressed younger caregivers, with low levels of mastery,
   who provide high-intensity support to spouses with cognitive
   difficulties may be at risk. Screening for these factors may help
   identify stroke families at risk for poor outcomes and may be used to
   more efficiently allocate health resources. (C) 2015 by the American

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a stroke-specific follow-up
   care model on quality of life for stroke patients, being discharged
   home, and their caregivers.
   Design: A non-randomized, controlled trial, comparing an intervention
   group with a control group (usual care).
   Subjects: Stroke patients and their caregivers.
   Methods: Intervention involved 5 home visits by a stroke care
   coordinator over a period of 18 months, using a structured assessment
   tool. Outcome measures were conducted at baseline (TO) and every 6
   months thereafter (T6, T12 and T18) in the domains of quality of life
   (primary), activities of daily living, social activities, depression,
   anxiety and caregiver strain.
   Results: The intervention group (n=62) had significantly increased its
   social activities after 18 months, whereas the control group (n=55)
   showed significantly decreased levels of social activities. In the first
   6 months, levels of depression decreased significantly in caregivers of
   the intervention group. No differences were found for quality of life
   and the other outcome measures.
   Conclusion: The intervention was not effective in improving quality of
   life, but was effective in improving levels of social activities. The
   intervention may have focussed too much on screening for stroke-related
   problems and not as much on adequate follow-up care and referral.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Little is known about mediators of stroke caregiver outcomes or
   patterns of relationships of outcome predictors. We examined
   relationships between the variable sets of caregiver and stroke survivor
   characteristics, coping (proposed mediators), and caregiver outcomes.
   Methods: We assessed 253 dyads prior to discharge from acute
   rehabilitation. Outcomes were depression, anxiety, preparedness, life
   change, and family functioning. Coping included problem solving,
   caregiver appraisal, and unmet resource needs. Multivariate canonical
   correlation analyses were computed between the sets of variables to
   identify unique patterns of relationships. Results: Six patterns of
   significant relationships were found (R=.30 to .84, Ps <.01 to .02). The
   strongest relationship was that between greater threat appraisal and
   negative life change, greater anxiety, and lower caregiving preparedness
   (P <.01). Caregiver characteristics (nonwhite, spousal caregivers) were
   related significantly to several outcomes (positive life change, lower
   anxiety, and less healthy family functioning) (R=.43, P<.01) and
   remained significant after controlling for the effect of mediators
   (R=.32, P<.02). Conclusion: Findings suggest various patterns of
   relationships that provide guidance for individualizing early caregiver
   intervention. Clinicians can build on caregivers' strengths while
   identifying threats to adaptation to tailor interventions that promote
   healthy outcomes.},

Abstract = {Guided by Orem's self-care deficit nursing theory, the purpose of this
   descriptive comparative study was to examine the emotional support,
   physical help, and health of caregivers of stroke survivors.
   Seventy-three caregivers from the Midwest participated in a parent study
   that examined their experience of caring during the first 12 months
   after stroke. Caregivers were randomized to an online intervention of
   support and education (n = 36 Web users) or a control group (n = 37
   non-Web users). A secondary analysis of data collected during telephone
   interviews at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after stroke was performed.
   No significant mean differences were found between Web and non-Web users
   in the above variables at these points in time. Consequently, the
   caregivers were merged into one group, and the relationships among the
   variables at the different points in time were analyzed. Significant,
   moderately positive relationships were found between emotional support
   and physical help at baseline, 3, and 12 months. There were also
   significant, moderately positive relationships between emotional support
   and caregiver health at 6 and 12 months. Results highlight the
   importance of caregivers (dependent care agents in Orem's terms)
   establishing an adequate self-care system that provides emotional
   support and physical help. Findings also denote the need for nurses (as
   caring agents) to assess caregiver health later in the caring process
   and be aware of its relationship to emotional support.},

Abstract = {Nine adult caregivers new to the role of caring for persons with stroke,
   upon discharge from rehabilitation centers in Ohio and Michigan and
   living farther away from formalized support services than urban
   caregivers, were enrolled for 3 months in a Web-based intervention
   project that examined the feasibility of the intervention and described
   the experience of caring, This article is an analysis of qualitative
   data from the intervention project that used a rigorous protocol to
   examine 68 perceived problems reported in caring. Problem themes in
   order of most to least frequent were 1) having independence issues, 2)
   dealing with emotions, 3) living with physical limitations, 4) managing
   co-morbid conditions, 5) balancing it all, 6) participating in physical
   therapy, and 7) having sleeping issues. These problems were related to
   four of Orem's universal self-care requisites. Although the total number
   of problems decreased over time, ``balancing it all{''} was the only
   problem that increased. This may be due to the resumption of the
   caregivers' regular activities or increased caregiving responsibilities.
   Nurses could use these findings to identify and focus on self-care needs
   of caregivers and to implement problem-resolution strategies.},

Title = {Qualitative Study of Chinese Stroke Caregivers' Caregiving Experience
   During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {STROKE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose:
   The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to disruptions
   in health care service delivery worldwide, inevitably affecting stroke
   survivors requiring ongoing rehabilitation and chronic illness
   management. To date, no published research has been found on stroke
   caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore
   Hong Kong stroke caregivers' caregiving experiences in the midst of this
   difficult time.
   Methods:
   Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 Chinese
   adult primary stroke caregivers from May to June 2020 via telephone.
   Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using an interpretive
   description approach and constant comparison strategy.
   Results:
   Five themes of the stroke caregiving experience during the COVID-19
   pandemic emerged: care service adversities, additional caregiving
   workload and strain, threatened relationship between caregiver and
   stroke survivors, threats to caregivers' physical and psychological
   well-being, and needs for continuing caregiving roles. Our findings
   suggested that caregivers have worsened physical and psychological
   well-being because of increases in care burden with simultaneously
   reduced formal and informal support. The relationship between caregiver
   and stroke survivor was subsequently affected, placing some survivors at
   heightened risk of abuse.
   Conclusions:
   Our study provides valuable findings about stroke caregiving experiences
   and needs during the pandemic. Delivery of psychological support,
   telemedicine, and household hygiene resources would be useful to
   mitigate caregivers' psychological distress during the COVID-19
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is among the major causes of short- and long-term
   disability. This study aimed to understand the caregivers (CGs) stress
   in stroke survivors. Materials and Methods: A 22-item questionnaire was
   administered to 201 CGs of stroke survivors. The variables tested were
   physical and mental health, social support, financial, and personal
   problems. CGs were divided into Group A (Barthel index {[}BI] <75) and B
   (BI >75) according to patient's BI, according to gender (male and female
   CG) and relation; spouses (wife, husband), daughters, sons,
   daughter-in-law, grandchildren, and rest (father, mother, brother,
   sister, and in-laws). Data were analyzed using SPSS software version-21.
   Data were analyzed to determine which variables of the patient effects
   the CG stress. Results: Majority of the CGs (74.62\%) were females. 65\%
   of CGs graded their burden as moderate to severe. 81\% of CGs had left
   their work for caregiving. More than half of the CGs felt sleep
   disturbance and physical strain. Psychological instability and financial
   burdens were reported in 3/4th of CGs. Group A CGs faced more sleep,
   financial, health, and social life disturbance. Patient's bladder and
   bowel problems, shoulder pain, patients noncooperative attitude for
   medication administration, and physiotherapy were more upsetting for
   Group A CGs. Female CGs were subjected to more sleep disturbance,
   physical and psychological stress, laced more difficulty regarding the
   patient's bladder, bowel, personal hygiene needs, and physiotherapy.
   Female CGs felt less motivated in caregiving than male CGs. Wives and
   daughters-in-law experienced more burden. Time spent and burden
   perceived was more by female CGs (chi(2) = 15.199, P = 0.002) than males
   (chi(2) = 11.931,P = 0.018); wives and daughters than other relations
   (chi(2) = 32.184, P = 0.000), (chi(2) = 35.162, P = 0.019). Conclusion:
   Our study showed that caregiving burden was predominantly shouldered by
   females CGs. CGs faced physical, psychological, and socioeconomic
   burden. The burden was more evident in female CGs and in patients with
   severe stroke.},

Title = {The relationship between the spiritual attitude of the family caregivers
   of older patients with stroke and their burden},
Journal = {CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {453-458},
Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is a chronic condition that necessitates
   multidimensional and overwhelming care. The caregivers of stroke
   patients are faced with various stressors that can threaten different
   aspects of their health, especially their mental health. Spiritual
   attitude and being spiritually oriented contribute significantly to
   mental health and can be used as a strategy for adapting to the
   stressful events that are part of the role of caregiving. This study was
   therefore conducted to investigate the relationship between the
   spiritual attitude of the family caregivers of older patients with
   stroke and their burden.
   Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016.
   The study population consisted of all the family caregivers of older
   patients with stroke presenting to health care centers and nursing
   service companies of Gilan Province in Iran. The participants were
   selected through convenience sampling and consisted of 407 participants.
   Data were collected using the Spiritual Attitude Scale and the Caregiver
   Burden Inventory and were then analyzed in SPSS-18 using Pearson's
   correlation coefficient at a significance level of 0.05.
   Results: The results showed that 88.9\% of the caregivers were females.
   The mean age of the participants was 38.3 +/- 8.8 years. The duration of
   caregiving was < 5 years in 84.4\% of the participants, while its mean
   was 4.2 +/- 2.5 years. The mean score of spiritual attitude was 108.77
   +/- 6.20. The majority of the participants (49.3\%) had moderate and
   relatively favorable spiritual attitude (a score of 72-120), 27.8\% had
   high or favorable spiritual attitude; 8.7\% had mild burden, 54.4\% had
   moderate burden and 37\% had favorable burden. The mean score of burden
   was 28 +/- 12.75. A statistically significant positive relationship was
   observed in this study between the mean score of spiritual attitude and
   the total score of burden in all its dimensions, namely, time
   dependence, as well as the developmental, physical, social and emotional
   dimensions.
   Conclusion: Providing strategies for improving spirituality, such as
   teaching spiritual selfcare, can improve their burden. Given that such
   strategies are psychologically approved and pose no side effects, they
   can be used as an effective, low-cost and risk-free approach for all
   caregivers, so that they can acquire the necessary spiritual support for
   overcoming the stress caused by caring for family members through the
   reinforcement of their spiritual beliefs in the ultimate effort to
   provide effective care to older patients while maintaining their own
   health and quality of life.},

Abstract = {BackgroundCaregivers play important roles in the collaborative efforts
   that characterize successful stroke rehabilitation, and their quality of
   life (QoL) may have implications for outcome of care.
   AimThis study explored the QoL of caregivers of community-dwelling
   stroke survivors in north-eastern Nigeria.
   MethodsFifty-nine caregivers of community-dwelling stroke survivors
   attending physiotherapy out-patients departments of two government
   hospitals in the city of Maiduguri participated in the study.
   Information on participants' age, gender, employment status, educational
   background, relationship with the stroke patient, and time after onset
   of stroke were obtained through interview, while their QoL was assessed
   with WHOQoLBREF questionnaire. Demographic and QoL data were summarized
   with descriptive statistics, and influence of caregivers and care
   recipients' factors on QoL was analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test.
   ResultsMajority of caregivers were males (55.9\%) and provided care for
   their parents (69.5\%) who had suffered stroke within 1year prior to
   study (72.9\%). Mean scores on all QoL domains were above average with
   the physical domain recording the lowest scores. Caregivers' factors of
   age, educational background and employment, and duration poststroke
   onset were significantly associated with domains of QoL.
   ConclusionAlthough QoL of stroke caregivers was fair across domains, the
   physical domain recorded the lowest mean scores. Older age, lack of
   formal education, unemployment and caring for stroke patients within the
   second year poststroke were associated with lower QoL scores.
   Information from this study may aid in identifying those caregivers who
   require support programmes and care the most.},

Abstract = {The study aimed at determining the quality of life (QOL) of caregivers
   of stroke survivors in a Nigeria population and some patient and
   caregiver-related variables that may be associated with it.
   A survey of the QOL of volunteering informal caregivers of stroke
   survivors in purposively selected tertiary health centres from
   South-Eastern Nigeria was done using the SF-12 questionnaire.
   Caregivers rated their QOL fairly well. Older age, female gender and
   closeness in relationship to survivor were caregivers' variables that
   were significantly related to poorer QOL scores. Being a woman close
   relative is associated with lower mental health scores while being an
   older close relative contributed to lower physical health score (P <
   0.05). Caregivers' scores on the physical and mental health domains
   correlated moderately with each other (r = 0.52) and highly with their
   overall QOL scores (r = 0.81 and 0.88).
   Caring for stroke survivors in Nigeria seems to have adverse effects on
   the QOL of closer relatives who are either women or older. There is a
   need for clinicians to help those caregivers at risk find ways of
   improving and optimizing their QOL.},

Abstract = {Primary objective: To examine the prospective relation of caregiver
   problem-solving abilities and relationship satisfaction to caregiver
   depression 1 month following care recipient discharge from an inpatient
   stroke rehabilitation facility. Research design: Correlational,
   prospective design. Methods and procedures: Participants included 39
   women (average age = 51.47, SD = 20.59) and four men (average age =
   42.50, SD = 5.57) assuming caregiver roles for persons discharged from
   stroke rehabilitation. Main outcome measure: The Beck Depression
   Inventory was the outcome measure at discharge and 1 month later.
   Results: Caregivers experienced a significant decrease in depression
   scores between the discharge and 1-month assessments. Lower relationship
   satisfaction and dysfunctional problem-solving abilities were
   independently and significantly predictive of depression scores at
   discharge. Dysfunctional problem-solving abilities were indirectly
   predictive of depression 1 month later. Conclusions: Dysfunctional
   problem-solving abilities and low relationship satisfaction are
   associated with caregiver depression, but dysfunctional problem-solving
   abilities maintain an indirect association with depression over 1 month.
   Implications of these findings for developing problem-solving training
   programmes for caregivers post-discharge are discussed.},

Abstract = {Research indicates that informal caregivers of stroke survivors often do
   not have the information necessary to adequately manage the recovery
   process at home. This article presents findings on the information
   sources and needs of stroke caregivers both in Puerto Rico and the
   Mainland United States. Data were collected from 120 caregivers (42
   Puerto Rican, 78 Mainland) of veterans who had experienced a stroke. Of
   all caregivers, 22\% to 50\% reported the need for information related
   to stroke recovery. This need was greater for Puerto Rican caregivers
   compared with Mainland caregivers. Caregivers receive most of their
   information from their doctors, the Veterans Health Administration
   (VHA), and the Internet. This study highlights the need for information
   dissemination to Puerto Rican and Mainland caregivers within the VHA
   system. This dissemination is an important and ongoing goal of the
   Stroke Quality Enhancement Research Initiative and the VHA/Department of
   Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines.},

Abstract = {Aim: The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of a support
   program on the resilience of female family caregivers of stroke
   patients.
   Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial. The sample consisted 70
   female family caregivers (34 experimental, 36 control group). Data were
   collected three times (pretest-posttest, follow-up test). Data were
   collected using the demographical data form, the Family Index of
   Regenerativity and Adaptation-General.
   Results: A significant difference was determined between the
   experimental and control group's follow-up test scores for relative and
   friend support, social support and family-coping coherence. A
   significant difference was determined between the experimental group's
   mean pretest, posttest and follow-up test scores in terms of family
   strain, relative and friend support, social support, family
   coping-coherence, family hardiness and family distress.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the Support Program contributes
   to the improvement of the components of resilience of family caregivers
   of stroke patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability and community
   re-integration is a priority for stroke rehabilitation. In North
   America, we have a growing population of individuals whose first
   language is not English. Little is known about the experiences of
   visible minorities living in North America as they re-integrate into the
   community post stroke or how these experiences change over time.
   Specifically, this research aimed to explore the experiences and needs
   of Chinese stroke survivors and family caregivers as they return to
   community living using the Timing it Right Framework as a conceptual
   guide. We recruited Cantonese-speaking stroke survivors and family
   caregivers from outpatient rehabilitation programmes. Using qualitative
   interviews conducted in Cantonese or English, we examined their
   experiences and needs as they return to community living and explored
   the influence of culture and time on their experiences. The interviews
   were transcribed and translated, and then analysed using framework
   analysis. Using framework analysis, we coded the data corresponding to
   the phases of the Timing it Right framework to determine the influence
   of time on the themes. We interviewed five Cantonese-speaking stroke
   survivors and 13 caregivers in 2009. We identified two main themes: (i)
   Participants' education and support needs change over time and (ii)
   Chinese resources are needed across care environments. These resources
   include access to care in their preferred language, traditional Chinese
   medicine, and Chinese food during their recovery and rehabilitation. To
   optimise Chinese stroke survivors' and caregivers' community
   re-integration, healthcare professionals should provide timely and
   accessible education and be aware of the role of Chinese diet and
   traditional medicine in stroke survivors' rehabilitation.},

Title = {Dimensions of Uncertainty After Stroke: Perspectives of the Stroke

Abstract = {Background: There has been limited examination of uncertainty after
   stroke. The effects of stroke extend beyond the stroke survivor to
   impact on the family, and thus, an exploration of uncertainty with the
   stroke survivor-caregiver dyad is important to gain a fuller
   understanding. Methods: Stroke survivors and their family caregivers (n
   = 33) participated in eight focus groups. Transcripts from the focus
   groups were examined for recurrent themes using content analysis.
   Mishel's theory of uncertainty was used as a framework to classify the
   themes. Results: Participants reported uncertainty about (a) future
   events, in particular, recurrent stroke; (b) signs and symptoms of
   stroke; (c) stroke risk factor management; and (d) resources for
   poststroke care. The uncertainty was brought on by the lack of
   predictability of these future events, lack of information, and the
   complexity of poststroke care and corresponded to Mishel's four key
   elements of ambiguity, deficient information, lack of clarity, and
   unpredictability. Conclusions: The fear of recurrent stroke was a
   pervasive theme and may represent a window of opportunity to work
   actively with stroke survivors in managing their risk factors. Although
   certain aspects of uncertainty after stroke cannot be eliminated, we can
   intervene with stroke survivors and family caregivers to assist them in
   reframing their responses to uncertainty and to foster coping and
   promote health.},

Title = {The Relationship Between Perceived Life Changes and Depression in

Abstract = {Most people with stroke are being cared for at home by family
   caregivers. Giving care is stressful, and family caregivers are
   predisposed to care-related complications such as life changes and
   depression. This article is a report of a study that examined the
   relationship between the perceived care-related life changes and
   depression in family caregivers of people with stroke, and it identified
   predictors influencing depression and perceived care-related life
   changes. A convenience sample of 60 family caregivers completed one
   demographic data sheet and two questionnaires: Bakas Caregiving Outcomes
   Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Data were
   collected in a 1-month period in 2008. According to the findings, the
   mean score of the subjects on the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale was
   -5.70, representing an overall negative change related to the caregiving
   role. The prevalence of people at a risk of depression or being
   depressed was 40\%. Correlation analysis showed that, as perceived life
   changes score decreases (change for the worst), the score for the
   feeling of depression increases (r = -.692, p <= .001). Stroke
   survivors' functional disability significantly predicted both perceived
   care-related life changes and depression in caregivers. Assessment of
   caregivers of people with stroke for depressive symptoms should be
   incorporated in the initial nursing assessment process. The perceived
   life changes among caregivers should be closely monitored, and follow-up
   meetings should be planned to support caregivers. The functional
   disability in people with stroke could be a valuable criterion for
   planning care for their caregivers.},

   The effectiveness of home-based individual tele-care intervention for
   stroke caregivers in South Korea. International Nursing Review59,
   369-375 Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop effective
   intervention programmes that can reduce family caregiver burden as they
   provide care to stroke patients so that family caregivers can adapt to
   and deal with the new circumstances from the early stages of stroke. We
   also intended to verify the effectiveness of the developed programme.
   Methods: This study employed a quasi-experimental design with a
   repeated-measures analysis. We included five hospitals specialized in
   stroke care in Seoul Metropolitan areas. Seventy-three patients from
   these hospitals agreed to participate in this study. Results: The score
   of family caregiver burden decreased by 8.07 (+/- 18.67) in the
   experimental group and increased by 1.65 (+/- 7.47) in the control
   group, which was a significant difference (t = 2.257, P = 0.027) between
   pre- and post-intervention. The family caregiver burden of experimental
   group was significantly lower than the control group (F = 3.649, P =
   0.033). Conclusions: The home-based individual tele-care intervention,
   in addition to the hospital-based group programme, was cost-effective
   and supportive in reducing family caregivers' burden by providing
   relevant information for their needs in timely manner.},

   family caregivers: the Hong Kong experience. Arch Phys Med Rehabil
   2011;92:1462-7.
   Objective: To ascertain the clinical and sociodemographic factors
   associated with family caregivers' burden in Chinese patients with
   stroke in Hong Kong.
   Design: Cross-sectional design.
   Setting: Stroke Clinic.
   Participants: Patients (N=123) from a stroke clinic and their family
   caregivers.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Predictive factors of family caregivers' burden
   in Chinese stroke patients in Hong Kong. Caregivers' burden was assessed
   with the Caregiving Burden Scale (CBS). Patients' and caregivers'
   sociodemographic data and clinical characteristics were recorded.
   Physical and psychological conditions were measured and rated with the
   following instruments: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, Geriatric
   Depression Scale (GDS), Barthel Index, Instrumental Activities of Daily
   Living, Mini-Mental State Examination, Lubben Social Network Scale,
   Modified Life Event Scale (MLES), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
   (HADS), and a single question about fatigue.
   Results: In the univariate analysis, the CBS score had significant
   correlations with certain characteristics of caregivers (sex, GDS, HADS,
   depressive symptoms, fatigue, and MLES) and those of patients' (sex,
   age, education, GDS). Regression analysis revealed that caregivers' GDS
   and patients' education were the independent correlates of the CBS.
   Conclusions: The severity of depressive symptoms in Chinese stroke
   caregivers and patients' education are independent factors associated
   with the caregivers' burden. Further studies evaluating interventions on
   caregivers' burden should include the assessment and management of mood
   disorders.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This prospective longitudinal study investigated gender
   differences in caregiving spouses' adjustment to the challenges of a
   poststroke life situation based on the caregiving stress model of Yee
   and Schulz (2000), which we modified. Method: The sample consisted of 97
   stroke-survivor and spouse dyads who were questioned 3 months after
   stroke and again 1 year later. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck \&
   Steer, 1997), the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, \& Garbin,
   1988), and the Giessen Complaints List (Brahler \& Scheer, 1995) were
   used to capture mental health and physical complaints in stroke
   survivors' spouses. Covariance analytical methods (analysis of
   covariance; ANCOVA) were conducted on data from both measuring times to
   test gender-related interaction effects. Results: Generally, women
   caregivers reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms than did their
   men counterparts. However, 15 months after stroke onset, in cases where
   individuals with stroke had substantial cognitive and mental
   impairments, the opposite appeared to be true. The results supported the
   modified caregiving stress model. Women spousal caregivers seem to
   adjust better to cognitive and emotional changes in their partners than
   did caregiving husbands. Conclusions: The rehabilitation of stroke
   survivors may be more successful if gender differences in caregivers'
   adaptation to their partners' mental changes are taken into
   consideration in intervention programs for families of stroke survivors.
   Men spousal caregivers may need counseling aimed at supporting their
   adjustment to stroke-related cognitive and emotional changes in their
   wives.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to identify the needs of family members
   across rehabilitation treatment phases and treatment settings.
   Participants were 123 family caregivers in rehabilitation settings in
   South Korea that replied to the survey. The needs were measured by the
   Family Needs Questionnaire (FNQ) and the t-test and one-way ANOVA were
   used to analyze collected data. In the comparison of two rehabilitation
   phases, the family caregivers caring for their patients in the acute
   rehabilitation phase perceived the need for health information as more
   important than those in the postacute phase. In addition, the family
   caregivers caring for patients in the acute rehabilitation phase were
   less satisfied with community network support and family support than
   those in the postacute phase. In the comparison of treatment settings,
   family caregivers caring for their patients in outpatient clinic
   services showed the lowest satisfaction of their needs in four areas
   (health information, emotional support, instrumental support, and
   professional support) compared with those in inpatient facilities or day
   hospitals. Findings are discussed within the context of the empirical
   and theoretical literature and implications for social work practice are
   considered.},

Title = {Caring for stroke survivors: experiences of family caregivers in Sri
   Lanka - a qualitative study},
Journal = {TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION},

Pages = {397-402},
Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a life-changing event for both stroke survivors
   and their family caregivers. After receiving acute care at the hospital,
   family members are expected to take care of stroke survivors at home and
   to continue treatment and rehabilitation. The new role of ``informal
   caregiver{''} is a challenge that creates many difficulties for family
   caregivers that are not explicit in the Sri Lankan context.
   Objectives: This study aimed at exploring family caregivers' experiences
   of providing informal care for dependent stroke survivors.
   Methods: The sample was chosen by purposive sampling with a maximum
   variation by age, ethnicity, religion, educational level, relationship,
   and monthly income. Ten informal family caregivers to stroke survivors
   with hemiplegia who had been treated at the National Hospital of Sri
   Lanka participated in in-depth interviews analyzed using conventional
   content analysis.
   Results: Qualitative content analysis of data resulted in an overriding
   theme, ``Caring with love, against all odds,{''} along with four
   categories, ``Life alterations,{''}{''}Lack of
   resources;''{''}Compassionate care,{''} and ``Coping strategies.{''}
   Although the increased workload, restricted social life, physical
   problems, and knowledge and financial deficits were challenging for the
   family caregivers, self-strength and supportive social networks helped
   them to compassionately care for their stroke survivor.
   Conclusions: The phenomenon of family caregivers providing informal care
   for stroke survivors was explicated as compassionate care,
   notwithstanding numerous difficulties. The findings motivate further
   research and strategies to minimize family caregivers' burden and
   facilitate the positive aspects of caregiving to promote the health and
   well-being of both stroke survivors and their families.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the burden of cross-cultural care for stroke
   patients. This article compares the perceived burden for caregivers of
   stroke survivors in Korea and the United States. A brief interview was
   conducted to determine specific problem areas for caregivers. Caregiver
   burden (using the Sense of Competence Questionnaire) mid social support
   (using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory) also were measured. The
   overall-sense-of-burden-from-caregiving score was significantly higher
   in the Korean cohort than in the American cohort, as was the scale
   regarding satisfaction with the relationship with the recipient of care.
   The primary predictors of overall burden for the combined sample were
   caregiver and patient depression and insufficient social support. Lower
   perceived social support among Korean caregivers Was strongly related to
   caregiver depression, while it was more strongly related to increased
   hours of caregiving in the American sample, These findings can help
   rehabilitation nurses plan supportive interventions that incorporate
   cultural values for stroke survivors and their caregivers.},

Abstract = {Background: A high degree of burden is often experienced by informal
   caregivers of stroke survivors. However, little is known about the
   long-term impact of the caregiving role. This study sought to examine
   the relationship between social support and the psychological effects
   experienced by long-term caregivers of stroke survivors. Methods: The
   design was a prospective, multicentre, hospital-based stroke cohort
   study with 3 years of follow-up. Caregivers of participating stroke
   survivors completed questionnaires either through face-to-face interview
   or over the telephone. Primary outcome measures were the Medical Outcome
   Study (MOS) Social Support Survey and the Irritability, Depression, and
   Anxiety (IDA) Scale, and the association between them was investigated
   using multivariate logistic regression. Results: 174/217 (80\%) stroke
   survivors participated at 3 years, involving 116 informal caregivers
   (mean age 66.9 years, 71\% female). Increasing social support was
   correlated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and inward
   irritability in caregivers. Social support was independently associated
   with anxiety (OR 0.55, 95\% CI 0.35-0.85; p = .007) and inward
   irritability (OR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.29-0.77; p = .002). Furthermore, social
   support was significantly associated with carer strain, as assessed by
   the Caregiver Strain Index. Conclusions: The amount of social support
   available to long-term caregivers of stroke survivors may be an
   important factor in lowering psychological burden in these caregivers.},

Abstract = {Primary objective: This study examined sociodemographic, physical and
   psychosocial characteristics of family caregivers of stroke survivors at
   risk for depression.
   Research design: A correlational study.
   Methods and procedures: Data were collected from 52 family caregivers
   and care recipients with ischemic stroke. Data were collected 1-2 days
   before discharge from a rehabilitative facility and at 5, 9 and 13 weeks
   post-discharge.
   Main outcomes and results: Compared to African Americans, Caucasians had
   similar to3.7 times higher odds of being at risk. The odds of being at
   risk for depressive behaviour decreased by 30\% for each unit increase
   in belonging and increased by 5\% for each unit increase in burden.
   Conclusions: Family caregivers who are isolated from others may benefit
   from therapeutic interventions that facilitate social interaction and
   decrease caregiver burden. Ethnic differences in caregiver depression
   merit further research.},

Title = {Living on the edge: Family caregivers' experiences of caring for
   post-stroke family members in China: A qualitative study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Globally, one-third of the 15 million people with stroke
   suffer permanent physical, cognitive, and emotional impairment. Because
   of traditional Chinese culture and the limited development of the
   primary healthcare system, most stroke survivors are cared for and live
   with their family after hospital discharge. However, previous literature
   shows a lack of qualitative studies on family caregivers' experience of
   caring for their relatives in China.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the experience of
   family caregivers taking care of stroke survivors in China.
   Methods: An explorative design was used wherein qualitative
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with family caregivers in
   China. Family caregivers were selected from one city and three
   communities using a purposive sampling method until no new data were
   generated (n = 26). A thematic analysis was used for the data analysis
   in this study.
   Findings: Family caregivers' experience was described as living on the
   edge, which pulled their lives in multiple directions, created an
   unstable situation, and reduced their well-being and health. The
   participants believed they had total responsibility and felt that this
   was expected from both themselves and society. Little external
   understanding and insufficient support was emphasised, resulting in the
   caregivers feeling all alone,drained by caring, and like prisoners in
   their own lives. The family caregivers had to face all of the family
   events and make all of the decisions by themselves. They expressed love
   for their family members with stroke, but this was often overshadowed by
   feelings of sadness, depression, sensitivity, and anger. This resulted
   in an inability to see how things could improve and in the family
   caregivers being uncertain about the future.
   Conclusion: All of these findings increased understanding and added
   knowledge of this topic that has been seldom studied in China.
   Healthcare authorities and professionals should recognise and understand
   the lives and situations of family caregivers since their relatives had
   a stroke to further identify their difficulties and needs. Appropriate
   and effective support, both from government and society, should be
   planned and implemented for family caregivers to relieve them from
   caring for their relatives with stroke and maintaining the quality of
   their own lives. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Critical points in the experience of spouse caregivers of patients who
   have suffered a stroke. A phenomenological interpretive study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {Aims
   To explore and document the experiences and values of spouse caregivers
   of stroke survivors. To gain more in-depth knowledge of how the act of
   caring and the adaption process affects caregiving spouses.
   Materials and methods
   Phenomenological, qualitative study. This study included spouses of
   stroke survivors who also served as primary caregivers. Individual,
   semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and
   analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data
   was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was
   approved by our institution's Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics
   and Research Committee.
   Results
   Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in
   their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving
   duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is
   condensed into topics and subtopics: ``Caregiving and that's all{''}
   summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver
   impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, ``Breaking the
   couple's life together{''} enlightens the further consequences of stroke
   in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and
   rebuilt. Finally, ``Going through the (non) loss alone{''} alludes to
   how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by
   others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any
   acquired global disability.
   Conclusions
   A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a
   psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for
   ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as
   well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as
   individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected
   disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive
   and integrated approach focused on transition care. Care resources must
   be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their
   caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of
   the caregiving process.},

   a stroke (InCARE): study protocol for a randomised trial},

Abstract = {AimThis study aims at describing an intervention based on informal
   caregivers' skills when taking care of older people after a stroke
   (InCARE).
   BackgroundMost informal caregivers feel unprepared to deliver assistance
   in activities of daily living at home. This lack of preparedness can
   lead to misconceptions, burden and affect their health, which,
   consequently, may imply hospital readmissions or early
   institutionalization of the older adults.
   DesignA single blinded randomised trial.
   MethodsThis study will recruit 198 dyads, comprising old stroke
   survivors and their caregivers, who will be divided into two groups:
   intervention and control (protocol approved in May 2013). Inclusion
   criteria: (informal caregivers) absence of cognitive impairment;
   resident in the Cavado Region; to return the informed consent (older
   people) are over 65years of age; have had a first stroke and; be
   dependent on at least one of the self-care activities post hospital
   discharge. Primary outcome: informal caregivers' skills. Secondary
   outcomes: include burden and Health Quality of Life in informal
   caregivers; functionality, hospital readmission and institutionalization
   of older people stroke survivors, measured 1 and 3months after InCARE
   programme.
   DiscussionThe InCARE programme will highlight new ways to understand the
   feasibility of a large trial, which supports caregivers who take care of
   older people after a stroke. It will be expected that the level of
   burden decreases, thus helping informal caregivers enhance their quality
   of life. Also, it is expected that older people's functionality will be
   improved and that hospital readmission or institutionalization may be
   avoided.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {254-261},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Four of five families are affected by stroke. Many
   caregivers access the Internet and gather healthcare information from
   Web-based sources.
   Design: The purpose of this descriptive evaluation was to assess the
   usage and design of the Caring approximate to Web site, which provides
   education/support for family caregivers of persons with stroke residing
   in home settings.
   Sample and Setting: Thirty-six caregivers from two Midwest states
   accessed this intervention in a 1-year study. The average participant
   was 54 years old, White, woman, and the spouse of the care recipient.
   Methods: In a telephone interview, four Web site questions were asked
   twice a month/bimonthly, and a 33-item survey at the conclusion of the
   study evaluated the Web site usage and design of its components.
   Descriptive analysis methods were used, and statistics were collected on
   the number of visits to the Web site.
   Results: On average, participants logged on to the Web site 1-2 hours
   per week, although usage declined after several months for some
   participants. Participants positively rated the Web site's appearance
   and usability that included finding the training to be adequate.
   Conclusion: Web site designers can replicate this intervention for other
   health conditions.},

Abstract = {Objective: to analyze the impact that caring has on a member of the
   family caring for a patient after a cerebrovascular accident,
   correlating life modifications and mental suffering with the perceived
   burden. Method: a cross-sectional, quantitative study, undertaken in
   January-April 2010 in Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil. Result: 61 individuals
   were investigated, monitored by three hospitals' Home Care Program. Data
   collection was through interviews for identifying life changes, and
   through the application of three scales for investigating perceived
   burden, mental state and mental suffering. Respectively these were the
   Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
   and the Self Reported Questionnaire (SRQ). The majority of the carers
   were female, married, and the children of the stroke patients. The
   average age was 48.2 years (+/-12.4). The most-cited life modifications
   referred to the daily routine, to leisure activities, and to exhaustion
   or tiredness. Regarding burden, the dimensions of General tension,
   Isolation and Disappointment stood out. It was ascertained that overload
   was more severe when the carer presented more symptoms of psychological
   distress, in the absence of a secondary carer, and when the principal
   carers reported perceiving changes in their bodies and health.
   Conclusion: an association between burden and the carer's mental state
   was not observed. Understanding the care, through analysis of the burden
   and of the knowledge of the biopsychosocial situation will provide
   support for the nurse's work in reducing the overload for family
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose:
   The purpose of this study was to investigate factors related to
   caregiving appraisal for family caregivers of older stroke patients in
   Korea.
   Method:
   A descriptive, cross-sectional survey of a sample of 242 family
   caregivers (95.7\% response rate) was conducted in Korea from 1 January
   2005 to 4 January 2007. Data were collected from outpatient stroke
   centres at three hospitals and two home health agencies located in
   Seoul, the capital city of Korea, its suburban area of Kyunggi-do, and
   the rural areas Gyeongsangbuk-do and Chungcheongbuk-do. The
   questionnaire was self-administered. spss 13.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
   USA) was used to perform frequency, percentage, mean standard deviation,
   t-test or analysis of variance, and Pearson's correlation calculations.
   Results:
   Caregiving appraisal was statistically different based on the
   caregiver's location of residency and the relationship between the
   caregiver and the recipient. The caregivers who resided in urban areas
   reported higher scores of caregiving appraisal compared with those who
   resided in rural areas. With regard to the caregiver-recipient
   relationship, spouses reported the highest caregiving distress status,
   followed by daughters-in-law, sons and, finally, daughters. In addition,
   caregiving distress significantly correlated with age (r = 0.151, P =
   0.022), the number of caregiving hours per week (r = 0.198, P = 0.003)
   and filial obligations (r = 0.336, P = 0.000).
   Discussion:
   The study results helped to better understand the caregiving process of
   Korean family caregivers. The data emphasized the importance of
   examining the expression of cultural roles and individual values on the
   caregivers' quality of life in diverse cultures. The knowledge gained
   from this study will be utilized to develop culture-specific
   interventions and social policies to directly support Korean family
   caregivers and to indirectly support stroke patients.},

Title = {Informal caregivers and racial/ethnic variation in health service use of
   stroke survivors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},

Pages = {233-241},
Abstract = {We investigated the racial and ethnic variation in health service use
   among stroke survivors with informal caregivers in a number of
   Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in one Veterans
   Integrated Service Network in the southeastern United States. We focused
   on the role of caregivers as an enabling factor in the use of health
   services. One hundred twenty-five veterans who had been hospitalized
   after an acute stroke, been released home, and identified an informal
   caregiver were enrolled in the study. Veterans and caregivers were
   surveyed at four time points over 12 months. Poisson multivariate
   regression analyses were used to model the relative risk (RR) of health
   service use. African Americans and Puerto Ricans were half as likely as
   Caucasians to use inpatient therapy services (RR = 0.522 and 0.494,
   respectively; p < 0.01), Puerto Ricans were less likely to be admitted
   to the hospital (RR = 0.689, p < 0.05), and Puerto Ricans were more
   likely to use outpatient services than Caucasians (RR = 1.230, p <
   0.01). Stroke survivors that received more hours of informal care were
   associated with a higher likelihood of outpatient service use (RR =
   1.01, p < 0.01). Stroke survivors living with their caregiver had a
   lower likelihood of inpatient therapy use (RR = 0.791, p < 0.01) and a
   higher likelihood of outpatient service use (RR = 1.17, p < 0.01).
   Greater likelihood of inpatient therapy (RR = 1.340, p < 0.01) and
   outpatient services (RR = 1.160, p < 0.05) was related to caregivers who
   received outside help. This study provides insight into the role of
   informal care in health service use for stroke survivors.},

Title = {Factors influencing sedentary behaviours after stroke: findings from
   qualitative observations and interviews with stroke survivors and their
   caregivers},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Background Stroke survivors are more sedentary than healthy, age-matched
   controls, independent of functional capacity. Interventions are needed
   to encourage a reduction in overall sedentary time, and regular breaks
   in prolonged periods of sedentary behaviour. This study captured the
   views and experiences of stroke survivors and their caregivers related
   to sedentary behaviour after stroke, to inform the development of an
   intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour. Methods Mixed-methods
   qualitative study. Non-participant observations were completed in two
   stroke services, inclusive of inpatient and community settings in the
   United Kingdom. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stroke
   survivors and their caregivers (if available) at six- or nine-months
   post-stroke. Underpinned by the capability, opportunity and motivation
   (COM-B) model of behaviour change, observational data (132 h) were
   analysed thematically and interview data (n = 31 stroke survivors,n = 12
   caregivers) were analysed using the Framework approach. Results
   Observation participants differed in functional ability whereas stroke
   survivor interviewees were all ambulant. Six themes related to sedentary
   behaviour after stroke were generated: (1) sedentary behaviour levels
   and patterns after stroke; (2) the physical and social environment in
   the stroke service and in the home; (3) standing and movement capability
   after stroke; (4) emotion and motivation after stroke; (5) caregivers'
   influence on, and role in influencing stroke survivors' sedentary
   behaviour; and (6) intervening to reduce sedentary behaviour after
   stroke. Capability, opportunity and motivation were influenced by the
   impact of the stroke and caregivers' inclination to support sedentary
   behaviour reduction. Stroke survivors reported being more sedentary than
   they were pre-stroke due to impaired balance and co-ordination,
   increased fatigue, and reduced confidence in mobilising. Caregivers
   inclination to support stroke survivors to reduce sedentary behaviour
   depended on factors including their willingness to withdraw from the
   caregiver role, and their perception of whether the stroke survivor
   would act on their encouragement. Conclusions Many stroke survivors
   indicate being open to reducing sedentary behaviour, with appropriate
   support from stroke service staff and caregivers. The findings from this
   study have contributed to an intervention development process using the
   Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) approach to develop strategies to reduce
   sedentary behaviour after stroke.},

Abstract = {Background: Care for stroke patients at home is a very complicated and
   tough activity.
   Objective: The study was conducted to examine the effect of patient care
   education on burden of care and quality of life of caregivers of stroke
   patients.
   Materials and methods: The study was an educational trial conducted on
   100 caregivers of the stroke patients in Al-Zahra educational hospital,
   Isfahan, Iran. The intervention group received some training to empower
   caregivers in family-oriented care in form of an educational counseling
   program. Data were collected and analyzed using the questionnaires,
   including demographic, quality of life Short Form-36, and Zarit burden
   of care questionnaires.
   Results: The mean ages of caregivers were 48.52 years in the
   intervention and 45.14 years in the control groups. The results
   indicated significant differences in mean of quality of life and burden
   of care in the caregivers of the intervention group after intervention
   (P< 0.01), which was insignificant in the control group. The average
   burden on the caregivers of both groups was significantly associated
   with health status, economic status, marital status, the number of
   children, care hours, care days, and familial relationship of the
   caregivers with the patients (P< 0.01) before intervention. In addition,
   quality of life of both groups was significantly related to their health
   status (P< 0.01) before intervention.
   Conclusion: Patient care education reduced the burden of care and
   improved quality of life of the caregivers of stroke patients. Thus, to
   reduce the complications of caring for stroke patients, family education
   should be the priority of nursing and discharging procedures.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To explore the mobility-related preferences among stroke
   survivors and caregivers following post-acute rehabilitation at
   inpatient or skilled nursing facilities.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study; semi-structured, qualitative
   interviews of stroke survivors (n = 24) and informal caregivers (n = 15)
   were conducted. The participants were recruited from the community.
   Results: Comparative content analysis was used to identify themes by two
   independent coders. The survivors (68 years) and caregivers (58 years)
   mentioned mobility-related consequences including inability to walk,
   balance, drive, and transfer; and increased falls. The survivors (63\%)
   and caregivers (73\%) also mentioned the use of assistive devices. The
   common rehabilitation activities included: walking (62\%); followed by
   standing and mobility; strength and balance; and wheelchair skills. Some
   stroke survivors were dissatisfied as their rehabilitation was not
   patient-centered. Frequently mentioned outcome preferences by survivors
   were ability to walk (88\%), move, and balance. They also wanted to
   acquire assistive devices to move independently. Caregivers were
   concerned with the survivor's safety and wanted them to drive (53\%),
   prevent falls, have home accommodations, and transfer independently.
   Caregivers (40\%) also expressed the importance of receiving realistic
   information.
   Conclusions: This study suggests a need to consider the stroke
   survivors' and caregivers' mobility outcome preferences to improve the
   patient-centered rehabilitation care.},

   between well-being, survivors' characteristics, and caregiver burden. We
   interviewed a convenience sample of 51 community-dwelling stroke
   survivors, at least 1 year after the last stroke event, and their
   primary caregivers. Disability of survivors was assessed using the
   Barthel index and the modified Rankin Scale; health-related quality of
   life by the SF-36 questionnaire; and depression and anxiety using the
   Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Caregivers filled the SF-36
   questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale questionnaire, and the
   Zarit Burden Interview, which assesses caregiver burden. Caregivers
   reported low levels of health-related quality of life and high levels of
   burden, anxiety, and depression. Caregivers' anxiety level was higher
   than that of the survivors (7.7 +/- 5.1 vs. 5.8 +/- 4.5, respectively;
   P= 0.02). Anxiety was the only characteristic of caregivers that was
   associated with overall caregiver burden. Our study suggests that there
   is a spillover effect of the disease on stroke patients' primary
   caregivers. Intervention programs for caregivers should focus on their
   mental state and address their specific needs. Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {Informal caregivers of stroke survivors experience elevated chronic
   stress and are at risk of developing depressive symptoms. The cumulative
   effects of chronic stress can increase allostatic load and dysregulate
   biological processes, thus increasing risk of stress-related disease.
   Stress-induced alterations in the pattern of cortisol secretion vary
   with respect to stressor onset, intensity, and chronicity. Little is
   known about the psychoendocrine response to stress in female caregivers
   of stroke survivors. The purpose of this study was to examine perceived
   stress, caregiver burden, and the association between caregiver
   depressive symptoms and diurnal cortisol in 45 females caring for a
   significant other who experienced a stroke within the past year. Women
   completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)
   and collected saliva for cortisol upon awakening, 30 min postawakening,
   noon, and bedtime for 2 consecutive days. Results revealed that women
   had high levels of perceived stress and caregiver burden. In women with
   CES-D scores >= 16, salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower
   across the day relative to women with CES-D scores < 16. This difference
   persisted after adjusting for age, number of caregiving hours per week,
   perceived social support, and quality of sleep. Younger age was
   associated with more depressive symptoms as well as lower levels of
   cortisol at awakening and 30 min postawakening. Results demonstrate that
   the burden of caregiving increases risk of depressive symptoms and
   hypocortisolism across the day. Hypocortisolism may contribute to
   increased risk of depressive symptoms as a result of the loss of
   glucocorticoid attenuation of stress-induced inflammation.},

Abstract = {This article reports a preliminary investigation in India of the
   association between caregiver burden and quality of life (QOL) in older
   persons with stroke after controlling for disability, depression, and
   sociodemographic factors. A cross-sectional analysis was carried out
   with 46 stroke patients attending a community hospital in India. The
   primary outcome variable was patient QOL assessed using the World Health
   Organization Quality of Life questionnaire-short form (WHOQOL-Bref). The
   primary explanatory variable was caregiver burden, assessed using the
   Zarit Inventory. Patient economic dissatisfaction (F = 6.12, p = .04),
   patient depression (F = 20.8, p < .001), and caregiver burden (F = 7.36,
   p = .009) were found to be associated with lower patient QOL. Caregiver
   burden was independently associated with lower patient QOL after
   controlling for patient depression, disability, and economic
   dissatisfaction (standardized B coefficient=-0.28, p = .03). The level
   of caregiver burden was a significant correlate of QOL after stroke.
   Implications for future studies and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Background and Purposes: Primary informal caregivers play a significant
   role in providing care to stroke survivors after having been discharged
   from the hospital. Our aims were to describe the characteristics of Thai
   stroke caregivers and to explore their needs while providing care to
   their stroke relatives. Methods: Using open-ended questions, we
   individually interviewed 20 caregivers of stroke survivors to identify
   their characteristics and their own needs. Additional field notes were
   made during all interviews. Results: Our findings revealed that the
   majority of Thai informal stroke caregivers in this study were female,
   mostly daughters, with the exception of 2 Thai primary stroke caregivers
   found to be nieces. The majority of caregivers provided care to their
   stroke relatives 24 h per day. The four major categories of informal
   rehabilitation were: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual
   rehabilitation activities. Assistance, information and social support
   were the three main needs of the caregivers. Conclusion: Based on these
   findings, appropriate nursing information and assistance focusing on
   rehabilitation and stroke caregivers' needs should be provided to Thai
   stroke caregivers performing informal care to ensure that both patients
   and caregivers have the best possible quality of life. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {Background: Caregivers of stroke survivors often suffer depressive
   symptoms that interfere with their own health. Early recognition may
   lead to attenuation of symptoms and better health and well-being for
   caregivers.
   Objective: We examined characteristics of caregivers and stroke
   survivors associated with caregivers' depressive symptoms in the early
   poststroke period.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal exploratory
   observational study with a convenience sample of 63 caregivers of older
   adult (>= 65 years) stroke survivors recruited from urban acute-care
   settings. We enrolled caregivers by 2 weeks poststroke (T1) and
   revisited them 4 weeks later (T2). Depressive symptoms were measured
   using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A separate unadjusted linear
   mixed model was computed to explore significant associations between
   each caregiver or stroke-survivor characteristic and depressive
   symptoms.
   Results: Caregivers, on average, reported mild depressive symptoms at T1
   and T2. Each of the following characteristics was independently
   associated with caregiver depressive symptoms over the first 6 weeks
   poststroke: caregiver uncertainty (p < 0.001), perceived stress (p <
   0.001) but not cortisol levels (p = 0.858 on waking, p = 0.231 evening),
   coping (p < 0.001), social support (p = 0.006), race (p = 0.022), income
   (p = 0.001), time spent on care (p = 0.039), and stroke-survivor race (p
   = 0.033) and functional status (p = 0.003). At T2, caregiver depressive
   symptoms were correlated with evening cortisol level (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Caregiver and stroke-survivor characteristics may help
   identify caregivers at highest risk for early depressive symptoms and
   guide interventions aimed at their resolution.},

Title = {Quality of Life Trajectories Among Stroke Survivors and the Related
   Changes in Caregiver Outcomes: A Growth Mixture Study},

Abstract = {Objectives: To identify the distinct quality of life (QOL) trajectories
   among stroke survivors, and to evaluate the associations with their
   caregivers' burden, anxiety, and depression.
   Design: This was a longitudinal dyadic study.
   Settings: Stroke survivors and their informal caregivers were enrolled
   upon discharge from several rehabilitation hospitals, and they were
   followed during this multisite longitudinal study.
   Participants: The stroke survivors (N=405, mean age=70.7y) included
   older adult men (52.0\%), most of whom (80.9\%) had had ischemic
   strokes. The caregivers (n=244, mean age = 52.7y) included mostly women
   (65.2\%), most of whom were the survivors' children (50.0\%) or spouses
   (36.1\%).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Latent growth mixture modeling was used to
   identify the distinct QOL trajectories among the stroke survivors over
   the course of 12 months of recovery. The longitudinal associations
   between the stroke survivor QOL trajectories and the caregivers' burden,
   anxiety, and depression were evaluated. A multinomial regression was
   then used to identify the predictors of the various survivor QOL
   trajectories.
   Results: Three distinct survivor QOL trajectories were identified: high
   and slightly improving QOL, moderate and slightly worsening QOL, and
   markedly improving QOL. The caregivers' burden, anxiety, and depression
   mirrored the survivors' QOL trajectories. In the multinomial models, an
   older survivor age, hemorrhagic stroke, lower education, and coexisting
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or thyroid disease were
   significantly associated with a moderate and slightly worsening QOL
   trajectory. Women and blindness were associated with a markedly
   improving QOL survivor trajectory.
   Conclusions: A survivor's QOL trajectory after a stroke was associated
   with their caregiver's burden, anxiety, and depression. Those survivors
   belonging to the moderate and slightly worsening QOL trajectory and
   their caregivers, in particular, need special care, because they are at
   risk for the worst outcomes. (C) 2018 by the American Congress of

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a newly designed intensive
   caregiver education program (ICEP) on reducing cognitive impairment,
   anxiety, and depression in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. One
   hundred and ninety-six AIS patients were divided into ICEP group and
   Control group in a 1:1 ratio using blocked randomization method. In the
   ICEP group, the caregivers received ICEP, while in the Control group
   caregivers received usual education and guidance. All patients received
   conventional rehabilitation treatment. Cognitive impairment (assessed by
   Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and Montreal Cognitive
   Assessment (MoCA) score), anxiety (assessed by Hospital Anxiety and
   Depression Scale (HADS)-A score and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)
   score), and depression (assessed by HADS-D score and Self-rating
   Depression Scale (SDS) score) were assessed at baseline (M0), 3 months
   (M3), 6 months (M6), and 12 months (M12). Cognitive impairment score at
   M12 and cognitive impairment score change (M12-M0) were increased, while
   cognitive impairment rate at M12 was reduced in the ICEP group compared
   with the Control group. Anxiety score change (M12-M0), anxiety score at
   M12, and anxiety rate at M12 were decreased in the ICEP group compared
   with the Control group. Depression score change (M12-M0), depression
   score at M12, and depression rate at M12 were lower in the ICEP group
   compared with the Control group. Further subgroup analysis based on
   baseline features also provided similar results. In conclusion, ICEP
   effectively reduced cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression in AIS
   patients.},

Abstract = {Background/ObjectivesSocial support can prevent or delay long-term
   nursing home placement (NHP). The purpose of our study was to understand
   how the availability of a caregiver can affect NHP after ischemic stroke
   and how this affects different subgroups differently.
   DesignNested cohort study.
   SettingNationally based REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in
   Stroke (REGARDS) study.
   ParticipantsStroke survivors aged 65 to 100 (256 men, 304 women).
   MeasurementsData were from Medicare claims from January 2003 to December
   2013 and REGARDS baseline interviews conducted from January 2003 to
   October 2007. Caregiver support was measured by asking, If you had a
   serious illness or became disabled, do you have someone who would be
   able to provide care for you on an on-going basis? Diagnosis of ischemic
   stroke was derived from inpatient claims. NHP was determined using a
   validated claims algorithm for stays of 100days and longer. Risk was
   estimated using Cox regression.
   ResultsWithin 5years of stroke, 119 (21.3\%) participants had been
   placed in a nursing home. Risk of NHP was greater in those lacking
   available caregivers (log-rank P=.006). After adjustment for covariates,
   lacking an available caregiver increased the risk of NHP after stroke
   within 1year by 70\% (hazard ratio (HR)=1.70, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI)=0.97-2.99) and within 5years by 68\% (HR=1.68, 95\% CI=1.10-2.58).
   The effect of caregiver availability on NHP within 5years was limited to
   men (HR=3.15, 95\% CI=1.49-6.67).
   ConclusionIn men aged 65 and older who have survived an ischemic stroke,
   the lack of an available caregiver is associated with triple the risk of
   NHP within 5years.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Stroke survivors experience poor oral health when discharged
   from the hospital to the community. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based oral care training programme
   on knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy and practice behaviour of family
   caregivers. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The
   experimental group consisted of 48 family caregivers who received the
   home-based oral care training programme, and the control group consisted
   of 46 family caregivers who received routine oral care education. The
   outcomes were measured by the Knowledge of Oral Care, Attitude towards
   Oral Care, Self-Efficacy of Oral Care and Behaviour of Oral Care before
   the training programme, and at one and two months afterwards. The data
   were analysed using mixed model ANOVA to determine differences in the
   outcomes between the two groups. Results: The findings demonstrated that
   the intervention group had more knowledge (t = 8.80, P < 0. 001),
   greater self-efficacy (t = 3.53, P < 0.01) and better oral care
   behaviour (t = 11.93, P < 0.001) than the control group at one and two
   months, with statistically significant differences in oral care
   knowledge, self-efficacy and behaviour outcome over time. The attitude
   of the intervention group towards oral care practice was generally
   positive (mean of baseline and two month = 12.9 and 14.7), but no
   significant difference in attitude change between the control and
   intervention groups (t = 1.56, P = 0.12). The treatment interaction
   effect was significant for the family caregivers' behaviour of oral care
   at one and two months of the intervention for both groups. Conclusion:
   Our individualized home-based oral care education can achieve
   significant improvements in oral care knowledge and self-efficacy among
   family caregivers of stroke survivors, and it can sufficiently empower
   them to modify their oral care practices in a home-based healthcare
   environment.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. While
   health services focus on the needs of diagnosed persons, families
   provide extensive informal care with diverse effects on daily life and
   health. Understanding caregivers' experience is critical to support
   their health and sustained contributions. This exploratory study
   examined how caring for partners with stroke and aphasia impacts
   caregivers' activities, identifying possible differences according to
   race/ethnicity through the lens of occupation.
   Method: Mixed methods identified the occupational impact of caring for a
   partner with stroke and aphasia. Twelve participants completed the Carer
   Communication Outcome After Stroke, Occupational Gaps Questionnaire,
   Activity Card Sort, and a semi-structured interview.
   Findings: The impact of aphasia on caregivers varied greatly. The
   Occupational Gaps Questionnaire revealed gaps in cultural activities. On
   the Activity Card Sort, caregivers experienced occupational loss,
   primarily in low-demand leisure and social activities. Six themes
   emerged from the interviews: personal factors, finding new equilibrium,
   participation barriers, compensations for aphasia, uncertainty, and
   obligations. Trends differed somewhat by race/ethnicity.
   Conclusion: Findings have implications for health professionals working
   with individuals with stroke and aphasia. The caregivers' experience
   deserves attention to support their quality of life and wellbeing, which
   can promote sustained assistance for their relatives with stroke.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study examined whether spousal confidence in
   care-recipient recovery can predict recovery from activity limitations
   following stroke and how spousal confidence relates to stroke survivor
   self-efficacy for recovery. Design: A prospective design was used.
   Measures were gathered from stroke survivor/spouse dyads at two time
   points, both postdischarge from the hospital following stroke (N = 109).
   Main outcome measures: The dependent variable was recovery from
   ambulatory activity limitations over 6 weeks, as measured by the
   Functional Limitations Profile. A single spousal confidence item was
   tailored to an ambulatory behavior that the stroke survivors could not
   perform at Time 1. Results: Spousal confidence was correlated with
   ambulation recovery (r = -0.23, p <.05) and stroke survivor
   self-efficacy for recovery (r =.25, p <.05). Higher spousal confidence
   was associated with a better recovery and greater stroke survivor
   self-efficacy for recovery, but not with initial health status or
   practical support received. Conclusion: The relationship between
   caregiver confidence, care-recipient self-efficacy for recovery, and
   recovery outcomes needs further elucidation.},

Abstract = {Informal care provision presents many challenges. As the population
   ages, more people are forced to enter the role of informal caretaker.
   Despite the increase in the need for caregivers and the importance of
   providing care, there is little empirical research examining how men and
   women approach and cope with providing care. The current study examined
   stroke patients and their care providers to assess possible gender
   differences in the impact of caretaking on caretakers and care
   recipients. Results indicate no significant difference in patient
   well-being based on the gender of the caregiver. Some measures indicated
   that men have advantages as caregivers. Results are discussed with
   regard to the accuracy and utility of sex-role stereotypes about
   caregivers. In addition, these data provide potential insight about how
   to decrease caregiver burden, delay long-term hospitalization of the
   patient, and increase the quality of life for caretakers and patients.},

Title = {Recovering together: building resiliency in dyads of stroke patients and
   their caregivers at risk for chronic emotional distress; a feasibility

Abstract = {BackgroundA stroke is a sudden, life-altering event with potentially
   devastating consequences for survivors and their loved ones. Despite
   advances in endovascular and neurocritical care approaches to stroke
   treatment and recovery, there remains a considerable unmet need for
   interventions targeting the emotional impact of stroke for both patients
   and their informal caregivers. This is important because untreated
   emotional distress becomes chronic and negatively impacts quality of
   life in both patients and caregivers. Our team previously used mixed
   methods to iteratively develop a six-session modular dyadic intervention
   to prevent chronic emotional distress in patients with stroke and their
   informal caregivers called ``Recovering Together{''} (RT) using feedback
   from dyads and the medical team. The aim of the current study is to test
   the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of screening and
   randomization methods, acceptability of RT, satisfaction with RT,
   feasibility of the assessment process at all time points, and
   acceptability of outcome measures. Secondarily, we aimed to explore
   within-treatment effect sizes and change in clinically significant
   symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress (PTS). The
   larger goal was to strengthen methodological rigor before a subsequent
   efficacy trial.MethodsWe conducted a feasibility randomized controlled
   trial to evaluate the RT intervention relative to minimally enhanced
   usual care (MEUC) in stroke patients admitted to a Neurosciences
   Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU). Dyads were enrolled within 1 week of
   hospitalization if they met specific eligibility criteria. Assessments
   were done via paper and pencil at baseline, and electronically via
   REDCap or over the phone at post-intervention (approximately 6 weeks
   after baseline), and 3 months later. Assessments included demographics,
   resiliency intervention targets (mindfulness, coping, self-efficacy, and
   interpersonal bond), and emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and
   PTS). Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability markers.
   Secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, PTS, mindfulness, coping,
   self-efficacy, and interpersonal bond.ResultsWe consented 20 dyads,
   enrolled 17, and retained 16. Although many patients were missed before
   we could approach them, very few declined to participate or dropped out
   once study staff made initial contact. Feasibility of enrollment (87\%
   of eligible dyads enrolled), acceptability of screening, and
   randomization (all RT dyads retained after randomization) were
   excellent. Program satisfaction (RT post-test M = 11.33/12 for patients
   M = 12/12 for caregivers), and adherence to treatment sessions (six of
   seven RT dyads attending 4/6 sessions) were high. There were no
   technical difficulties that affected the delivery of the intervention.
   There was minimal missing data. For both patients and caregivers,
   participation in RT was generally associated with clinically significant
   improvement in emotional distress symptoms from baseline to post-test.
   Participation in MEUC was associated with clinically significant
   worsening in emotional distress. Although some of the improvement in
   emotional distress symptoms decreased in the RT group between post-test
   to 3 months, these changes were not clinically significant. RT was also
   associated with substantial decrease in frequency of individuals who met
   criteria for clinically significant symptoms, while the opposite was
   true for MEUC. There were many lessons that informed current and future
   research.
   ConclusionsThis study provided evidence of feasibility and signal of
   improvement in RT, as well as necessary methodological changes to
   increase recruitment efficiency before the future hybrid
   efficacy-effectiveness trial.Trial registrationNCT02797509.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the needs of family members at
   the bedside of stroke patients (n = 12) admitted to an inpatient
   rehabilitation facility (IRF). Family members' needs were determined
   through semistructured interviews, ``Draw a Bridge{''} art therapy
   technique, and the Family Inventory of Needs. Family members described a
   family-centered approach to care that addressed the following needs:
   assistance with preparing for discharge, staff caring for family
   members, communication about the plan of care and what to expect
   postdischarge, and trusting the care provided by IRF staff. Art therapy
   revealed that stroke was a crisis with many unmet needs for the
   interviewer to explore. Descriptive statistical analysis of the Family
   Inventory of Needs revealed that both met and unmet needs were
   consistent with the interviews and the interpretations of the drawings.
   These findings inform the need for interventions during IRF to enhance
   communication, support, and effective caregiver education amidst the
   crisis of stroke.},

Abstract = {BackgroundTo estimate the additional impact of coping and of being
   dependent on caregivers, over and above the large effects of disability
   on utility after ischemic stroke.MethodsA total of 539 patients were
   recruited into an observational, retrospective study when returning for
   a check-up between 3 and 36months after an ischemic stroke. Patients'
   modified Rankin Scale (mRS), dependency on caregivers, the Brandtstadter
   and Renner Coping questionnaire (with summary scores: Tenacity of Goal
   Pursuit (TGP) and Flexible Goal Adjustment (FGA) coping styles),
   EQ-5D-3L and co-morbidities were evaluated.ResultsIn multivariable
   regression, greater disability (mRS) resulted in large utility losses,
   between 0.06 for mRS 1 to 0.65 for mRS 5 (p<0.0001). Dependency on
   caregivers caused an additional dis-utility of 0.104 (p=0.0006) which
   varied by mRS (0.044, 0.060, 0.083, 0.115, 0.150 and 0.173 for mRS 0-5).
   The effect of coping on utility varied by coping style, by the
   disability level of the patient and by his or her dependency on
   caregivers. FGA coping was associated with additional increases in
   utility (p<0.0001) over and above the effect of disability and
   dependency, whereas TGA had no significant impact. FGA coping was
   associated with larger utility changes among more disabled patients
   (0.018 to 0.105 additional utility, for mRS 0 to mRS 5 respectively).
   Dependent patients had more to gain from FGA coping than patients who
   function independently of caregivers: utility gains were between 0.049
   and 0.072 for moderate to high levels of FGA coping. In contrast, the
   same positive evolution in FGA coping resulted in 0.039 and 0.057
   utility gain among independent patients. Finally, we found that
   important stroke risk factors and co-morbidities, such as diabetes and
   atrial fibrillation, were not predictors of EQ-5D utility in a
   multivariable setting.ConclusionsThis study suggests that treatment
   strategies targeting flexible coping styles and decreasing dependency on
   caregivers may lead to significant gains in quality of life above and
   beyond treatment strategies that solely target disability.},

Abstract = {Objective To evaluate effects of caregiver's education program on their
   satisfaction, as well as patient functional recovery, performed in
   addition to daily conventional rehabilitation treatment.
   Methods Three hundred eleven subjects diagnosed with first-onset stroke
   and transferred to the Department of Physical Medicine and
   Rehabilitation of Inha University Hospital were surveyed. In 2015,
   caregivers attended an education program for acute and subacute stroke
   patients. Patients who received an additional rehabilitation therapy
   were assigned to the experimental group (n=81), whereas the control
   group (n=100) consisted of transfer cases in 2014 with only conventional
   treatment. The experimental group was classified by severity using the
   Korean version of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
   (K-NIHSS), which was administered to all 181 subjects, in addition to,
   the Korean version of the Mini Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE), a
   Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI), and the Berg Balance Scale (K-BBS).
   Caregiver satisfaction and burden before and after education programs
   were assessed using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure
   (COPM), as well as family burden and caregiver burnout scales.
   Results No significant intergroup difference was observed between
   initial K-NIHSS, K-MMSE, K-BBS, K-MBI scores, and times from admission
   to transfer. Those with moderate or severe strokes under the
   experimental condition showed a more significant improvement than the
   control group as determined by the K-NIHSS and K-BBS, as well as
   tendential K-MMSE and K-MBI score increases. Satisfaction was
   significantly greater for family members and formal caregivers of
   patients with strokes of moderate severity in the experimental group.
   Conclusion The caregiver's education program for stroke subjects had a
   positive outcome on patients' functional improvement and caregiver
   satisfaction. The authors believe that the additional rehabilitation
   therapy with the education program aids patients to achieve functional
   improvements for an optimal return to social life.},

Title = {Caregiving Immediately After Stroke: A Study of Uncertainty in
   Caregivers of Older Adults},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE NURSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},

Pages = {343-351},

Abstract = {Background: Caregivers of stroke survivors experience high rates of
   mental and physical morbidity. Stroke has sudden onset, and the outcome
   is not immediately known. Uncertainties surrounding the new caregiving
   role may not only necessitate major changes in the lives of family
   caregivers but also contribute to negative health outcomes for the
   caregiver. Purpose: The purposes of this study were to describe
   caregiver uncertainty across the early weeks after a family member's
   stroke and to explore characteristics of caregivers and stroke survivors
   associated with that uncertainty. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal
   exploratory observational study was conducted with a convenience sample
   of 40 caregivers and older adult (65 years) stroke survivors recruited
   from urban acute care settings in the mid-Atlantic region. Caregivers
   were enrolled by 2 weeks poststroke (T1) and revisited 4 weeks later
   (T2). Uncertainty was measured usingthe Mishel Uncertainty in Illness
   Scale for Family Members. An unadjusted linear mixed model was computed
   to examine significant associations between each caregiver or stroke
   survivor characteristic and repeated measures of uncertainty. Results:
   Uncertainty at T1 (83.73 +/- 23.47) was higher than reported in other
   caregiver populations and remained high 6 weeks poststroke (T2: 85.23
   +/- 23.94). Each of the following characteristics was independently
   associated with greater caregiver uncertainty: caregivers' older age (p
   = .019), being a spouse (p = .01), higher stress (p < .001), more
   depressive symptoms (p = .001), more comorbidities (p = .035), and
   poorer coping capacity (p = .002) and stroke survivors' recurrent stroke
   (p = .034), poorer functional status (p = .009), and insurance type (p =
   .008). Conclusions: Caregivers experienced persistently high uncertainty
   during the first 6 weeks poststroke. Better understanding of
   uncertainty, its associated characteristics, and its outcomes may help
   clinicians identify caregivers at highest risk who may benefit from
   targeted interventions.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Programmes that address stroke family caregiver needs and
   skill-building are recommended based on the literature and patient care
   guidelines for stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to
   explore patterns of perceived needs and skill-building during a stroke
   caregiver intervention programme.
   Method: Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data from 123 stroke
   caregivers enrolled in the intervention group of a randomised controlled
   clinical trial. Caregivers received eight weekly telephone sessions,
   with a booster session a month later. At each session, the Caregiver
   Needs and Concerns Checklist (CNCC) was used to identify and prioritise
   current needs that were then addressed through skill-building
   strategies.
   Results: Perceived needs changed over time. Information about stroke was
   the highest priority need during Session 1. Managing survivor emotions
   and behaviours was the highest priority for Sessions 2 through 4.
   Caregivers generally waited until Sessions 5 through 9 to address their
   own emotional and physical health needs. Physical and instrumental care
   needs were relatively low but stable across all nine sessions.
   Skill-building was consistently high, though it peaked during Sessions 2
   and 3.
   Conclusions: Tracking patterns of needs and skill-building suggest
   appropriate timing for targeting different types of family caregiver
   support during stroke rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {The educational group has been proposed as an effective way to deliver a
   program based on structured stroke knowledge to enhance emotional
   support among people with stroke and their caregivers. The aim of this
   study was to explore whether the stroke educational group could increase
   stroke-related knowledge, and improve perceived health status, in
   persons with stroke and their caregivers, and thus reduce the stress
   induced during the care-giving process. In this study a
   quasi-experimental design, that included a pre-test and a post-test, was
   employed on a total of 54 patients with stroke and 32 caregivers who
   participated in a 2-week stroke educational group. The outcome measures
   included a Stroke Knowledge Test, the Short-Form 36 and the Relatives'
   Stress Scale. The tests were administrated before and after the running
   of the stroke educational group as well as, during the 1-week, 2-week
   and 1-month follow-up sessions. The results showed a statistically
   significant increase in stroke-related knowledge in the patients
   (F{[}1,51]=7.28-9.67, P < 0.01) and their caregivers
   (F{[}1,30]=44.19-80.49, P < 0.01), but no similar significant
   improvement was noted on perceived health status and care-giving stress.
   A significant association between the total scores in the stroke
   knowledge test and the admission scores in the Mini Mental State
   Examination of the patients was also revealed (F{[}1,51]=48.03-58.87, P
   < 0.01). In conclusion, the results suggest that there was an
   improvement in the acquisition of stroke-related knowledge by both
   patients with stroke, and their caregivers, after a stroke educational
   group. A further study exploring the behavioral changes of individuals
   with stroke and their caregivers; after attending a stroke educational
   group is recommended.},

Abstract = {To examine the satisfaction of spouses of stroke patients with the
   support given to them during clinical rehabilitation and to explore the
   relationships between satisfaction and characteristics of the support
   received.
   Spouses of patients with a first-ever supratentorial stroke were
   included (n = 194). Satisfaction was measured on a 0-10 scale. Bivariate
   and multivariate relationships were studied between overall satisfaction
   score and characteristics of the support provided (number of full days
   of attendance, participation in caregiver group, discipline providing
   most support), the spouses (age, gender, family situation, education and
   employment) and the patients (activity of daily living (ADL) dependency
   (Functional Independence Measure), length of stay).
   The median satisfaction score was 7, and 44\% of all spouses scored >= 8
   (very satisfied) but 23\% were dissatisfied. Spouses' and patients'
   characteristics and satisfaction scores were not associated. Of the
   support characteristics the number of full days of attendance (p =
   0.02), participation in a caregiver group (p = 0.006) and support
   received from a team member (p = 0.000) were related to satisfaction. No
   differences in spouses' satisfaction scores were found between the
   participating rehabilitation centres. Only 39\% of the spouses
   participated in a caregiver group. The most important reason for not
   participating in such a group was not being aware of the opportunity to
   take part in a group (49\%). Spouses participating in a group showed
   more depressive symptoms and had a more severely disabled partner.
   Caregiver support was primarily given by the nurse and the social
   worker. One in five spouses indicated not to have been supported at all
   by the rehabilitation team.
   A large proportion of the caregivers were satisfied with the care they
   had received, although one in four was dissatisfied. Satisfaction was
   related to support characteristics.},

Abstract = {Background: Recent studies estimate nearly half of the US population can
   access mobile medical applications (apps) on their smartphones. The are
   no systematic data available on apps focused on stroke
   survivors/caregivers. Objective: To identify apps (a) designed for
   stroke survivors/caregivers, (b) dealing with a modifiable stroke risk
   factor (SRF), or (c) were developed for other purposes but could
   potentially be used by stroke survivors/caregivers. Methods: A
   systematic review of the medical apps in the US Apple iTunes store was
   conducted between August 2013 and January 2016 using 18 predefined
   inclusion/exclusion criteria. SRFs considered were: diabetes,
   hypertension, smoking, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and dyslipidemia.
   Results: Out of 30,132 medical apps available, 843 (2.7\%) eligible apps
   were identified. Of these apps, (n = 74, 8.7\%) apps were specifically
   designed for stroke survivors/caregivers use and provided the following
   services: language/speech therapy (n = 28, 37\%), communication with
   aphasic patients (n = 19, 25\%), stroke risk calculation (n = 11, 14\%),
   assistance in spotting an acute stroke (n = 8, 10\%), detection of
   atrial fibrillation (n = 3, 4\%), direction to nearby emergency room (n
   = 3, 4\%), physical rehabilitation (n = 3, 4\%), direction to the
   nearest certified stroke center (n = 1, < 2\%), and visual attention
   therapy (n = 1, <2\%). 769 apps identified that were developed for
   purposes other than stroke. Of these, the majority (n = 526, 68\%)
   addressed SRFs. Conclusions: Over 70 medical apps exist to specifically
   support stroke survivors/caregivers and primarily targeted language and
   communication difficulties. Apps encompassing most stroke
   survivor/caregiver needs could be developed and tested to ensure the
   issues faced by these populations are being adequately addressed.},

Abstract = {Background Stroke is highly debilitating and requires long-term care.
   Informal caregivers of stroke survivors play important roles in stroke
   rehabilitation. Caring for stroke survivors can negatively affect the
   caregivers' well-being and may adversely impact on their caregiving
   quality and subsequently on stroke survivors' well-being. There seems to
   be a dearth of research on the relationships between caregivers' and
   stroke survivors' well-being. Aims and Objectives This study was
   designed to determine the relationships among informal caregivers'
   burden and quality of life (QOL) and stroke survivors' QOL and community
   reintegration. Methods This ethically certified cross-sectional survey
   involved 82 stroke survivors (mean age = 60.48 +/- 11.13 years) and
   their 82 primary caregivers (mean age = 36.13 +/- 13.69 years)
   consecutively recruited from seven conveniently sampled tertiary
   hospitals in Nigeria. Caregivers Strain Index, Igbo-culture adapted
   Maleka Stroke Community Reintegration Measure and Short-Form 36-item
   Health Survey questionnaires were used to assess the caregivers' burden,
   survivors' community reintegration and QOL (of survivors and
   caregivers), respectively. Data were analysed using descriptive
   statistics, Spearman rank, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests at
   alpha level of 0.05. Results The mean stroke survivors' community
   reintegration and QOL were 34.05 +/- 21.54\% and 34.93 +/- 16 +/- 49\%,
   respectively. The mean caregivers' QOL and burden scores were 74.49 +/-
   12.61\% and 9.13 +/- 3.18, respectively. About 80.5\% of the caregivers
   experienced significant burden. Stroke survivors' QOL and community
   reintegration, and caregivers' QOL and burden significantly correlated
   with one another (p < 0.05). Poststroke duration, survivor-caregiver
   cohabitation duration, survivors' community-dwelling duration and daily
   care-giving hours significantly correlated with each of stroke
   survivors' community reintegration and QOL, and caregivers' burden and
   QOL (p < 0.05). Conclusions Stroke survivors' community reintegration
   and QOL were poor while caregivers' had moderate QOL and high prevalence
   of significant burden. Significant correlations exist between
   caregivers' well-being and stroke survivors' QOL and community
   reintegration. Interventions targeted at reducing caregivers' burden may
   help improve both caregivers and survivors' well-being.},

Abstract = {Background: Family members frequently provide long-term care for stroke
   survivors, which can lead to psychological strain, particularly in the
   presence of cognitive decline. Objectives: To profile anxious and
   depressive symptoms of family caregivers at 5 years post-stroke, and to
   explore associations with stroke survivor cognitive decline. Methods: As
   part of a 5-year follow-up of the Action on Secondary Prevention
   Interventions and Rehabilitation in Stroke (ASPIRE-S) cohort of stroke
   survivors, family members completed a self-report questionnaire.
   Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the HADS-A and
   CES-D. Cognitive decline in stroke survivors was assessed from the
   caregiver's perspective using the IQCODE, with cognitive performance
   assessed by the MoCA. Data were analyzed using logistic regression
   models. Results: 78 family members participated; 25.5\% exhibited
   depressive symptoms, 19.4\% had symptoms of anxiety. Eleven stroke
   survivors (16.7\%) had evidence of cognitive decline according to both
   the IQCODE and MoCA. Family members of stroke survivors with cognitive
   decline were significantly more likely to report symptoms of depression
   {[}age-adjusted OR (95\% CI): 5.94 (1.14, 30.89)] or anxiety
   {[}age-adjusted OR (95\% CI): 5.64 (1.24, 25.54)] than family members of
   stroke survivors without cognitive decline. Conclusions: One-fifth of
   family caregivers exhibited symptoms of anxiety and one-quarter symptoms
   of depression at 5 years post-stroke. Stroke survivor cognitive decline
   was significantly associated with both depressive and anxious symptoms
   of family caregivers. Family members play a key role in the care and
   rehabilitation of stroke patients; enhancing their psychological
   wellbeing and identifying unmet needs are essential to improving
   outcomes for stroke survivors and families.},

Abstract = {AimsTo explore the organized stroke unit experience from the multiple
   perspectives of stroke survivor, family carer and the multi-disciplinary
   team.
   BackgroundOrganized stroke unit care reduces morbidity, mortality and
   institutionalization and is promoted globally as the most effective form
   of acute and postacute provision. Little research has focused on how
   care is experienced in this setting from the perspectives of those who
   receive and provide care.
   DesignThis study used a qualitative approach, employing Framework
   Analysis. This methodology allows for a flexible approach to data
   collection and a comprehensive and systematic method of analysis.
   MethodSemi-structured interviews were undertaken during 2011 and 2012
   with former stroke unit stroke survivors, family carers and senior
   stroke physicians. In addition, eight focus groups were conducted with
   members of the multi-disciplinary team.
   ResultsOne hundred and twenty-five participants were recruited. Three
   key themes were identified across all data sets. First, two important
   processes are described: responses to the impact of stroke and seeking
   information and stroke-specific knowledge. These are underpinned by a
   third theme: the challenge in building relationships in organized stroke
   unit care.
   ConclusionsStroke unit care provides satisfaction for stroke survivors,
   particularly in relation to highly specialized medical and nursing care
   and therapy. It is proposed that moves towards organized stroke unit
   care, particularly with the emphasis on reduction of length of stay and
   a focus on hyper-acute models, have implications for interpersonal care
   practices and the sharing of stroke-specific knowledge.},

   characteristics of individuals with stroke sequelae. Method:
   descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative research, conducted with 136
   family caregivers of individuals with stroke sequelae by means of home
   interviews from April to June 2013. Results: we found that caregivers of
   individuals aged under 65 years, married, with 10 to 12 years of formal
   education, presented higher scores, respectively, in the domains `Social
   aspects', `Emotional aspects', and `Mental health'. However, caregivers
   of patients with higher degree of disability obtained lower score in the
   `Mental Health' domain. Conclusion: the results foster reflection on the
   need of including the family caregivers of individuals with stroke
   sequelae in the planning of care provided by health professionals.},

Abstract = {Objective: Compare caregiver burden, provision of informal care,
   participation in everyday occupations and life satisfaction of
   caregivers to people with stroke, who either had received a
   client-centred, activities of daily living intervention or usual
   activities of daily living interventions.
   Design: A multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial in which 16
   rehabilitation units were randomly assigned to deliver a client-centred,
   activities of daily living intervention or usual activities of daily
   living interventions. Caregiver outcomes were compared cross-sectionally
   at 12months and changes in outcomes between three and 12 months after
   people with stroke were included in the study.
   Setting: Inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation.
   Participants: Caregivers of people with stroke enrolled in the trial.
   Intervention: A client-centred, activities of daily living intervention
   aiming to increase agency in daily activities and participation in
   everyday life for people after stroke.
   Main measures: Caregiver Burden Scale, Occupational Gaps Questionnaire,
   LiSat-11.
   Results: There were no differences in outcomes between caregivers in the
   client-centred, activities of daily living (n=88) and the usual
   activities of daily living (n=95) group at 12months. The caregiver
   burden score was 42.7 vs. 41.8, p=0.75, mean occupational gaps were 3.5
   vs. 4.0, p=0.52 and satisfaction with life was 53\% vs. 50\%, p=0.87.
   There were no differences in changes between three and 12months.
   However, within groups there were significant differences in caregiver
   burden, factor general strain, for caregivers in the client-centred,
   activities of daily living group, and in provision of informal care for
   the usual activities of daily living group.
   Conclusion: The client-centred intervention did not bring about any
   difference between caregiver-groups, but within groups some difference
   was found for caregiver burden and informal care.},

Title = {A Qualitative Study of Family Caregiver Experiences of Managing
   Incontinence in Stroke Survivors},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Background
   Incontinence is a common problem faced by family caregivers that is
   recognized as a major burden and predictor of institutionalization.
   However, few studies have evaluated the experiences of family caregivers
   caring for stroke survivors with incontinence.
   Purpose
   To describe experiences of caregivers managing incontinence in stroke
   survivors.
   Design
   This qualitative descriptive study employed a grounded-theory approach.
   Methods
   Semi-structured in-depth interviews with ten family caregivers of stroke
   survivors with incontinence were conducted during 2011. Audiotaped
   interviews were transcribed and analyzed using content analysis.
   Findings
   Data analysis identified four themes: chaos, hypervigilance, exhaustion,
   and creating a new life. There were nine related subcategories: fluster,
   dirtiness, urgency, fear of potential health-hazard, physically
   demanding and time-consuming, mentally draining, financial burden,
   learning by doing, and attitude adjustment. Together, these described a
   process of struggling to cope with the care of stroke survivors with
   urinary/fecal incontinence. Of the four categories, ``creating a new
   life{''} developed gradually over time to orient caregivers to their new
   life, while the other three categories occurred in a chronological
   order.
   Conclusion
   The research highlighted unique caring experiences of family caregivers
   of stroke patients, which focused solely on the `incontinence issue'.
   Understanding these experiences may help nurses provide better support
   and resources for family caregivers when caring for stroke survivors
   with incontinence.},

Abstract = {PurposeStroke survivor behaviors that caregivers identify as bothersome
   can lead to family caregiver stress, which can result in premature
   institutionalization of the survivor. The purpose of this study was to
   explore demographic and theory-based factors associated with survivor
   bothersome behaviors as identified by family caregivers.
   MethodsA secondary analysis of a combined sample of 96 family caregivers
   of stroke survivors was conducted using baseline data from two existing
   studies. Bothersome behaviors were measured using the Revised Memory and
   Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC). Theory-based factors were measured
   using well-validated scales.
   ResultsMale stroke survivors exhibited more bothersome behaviors
   (t=3.53, p<.01). After controlling for survivor gender, 35\% of the
   variance in bothersome behaviors was explained by caregiver depressive
   symptoms, task difficulty, life changes, and threat appraisal (F{[}5,
   88]=10.82, p<.001).
   ConclusionsThese results identify potential areas for nursing
   interventions designed to reduce bothersome behaviors as identified by
   family caregivers.},

Abstract = {Aim. To describe the relationship between self-appraised problem-solving
   abilities and psychological distress, burden and perceived social
   support in informal, family stroke caregivers. Background. Previous
   research suggests that self-appraised problem-solving abilities play a
   significant role in the well-being of family caregivers of patients with
   chronic illness. However, little is known about its role in caregivers
   of stroke survivors. Design. Prospective correlational study. Methods.
   One week before discharge, 103 family caregivers of survivors of a first
   stroke were assessed for their perceived problem-solving abilities,
   social support, anxiety, depression and physical well-being. At three
   months postdischarge, 85 of these caregivers (83\% retention) were
   reassessed on the same measures. In addition, their levels of burden and
   perceived difficulties were also measured. Results. Using multiple
   regression, overall self-appraised problem-solving abilities and its
   subscale ` confidence in problemsolving' at one week before discharge
   were significant predictors of caregiver perceived social support (R 2 =
   29\%) and perceived physical well-being (R 2 = 42\%) at three months
   postdischarge. Other relationships were non-significant. Conclusions.
   Caregivers' perceived social support and physical well-being were
   significantly predicted by confidence in problem- solving. Relevance to
   clinical practice. This study is timely given the challenges facing
   health systems in Hong Kong to effectively manage chronic illness
   through family-centred care. The significant relationships between
   caregiver self-appraised problemsolving, perceived social support and
   well-being suggest that interventions maximising caregiver confidence in
   problem-solving might be valuable in supporting family caregivers of
   stroke survivors. Nurses working with families caring for stroke
   survivors both close to discharge and in the early transition stages
   back at home may be in an ideal position to offer this support.},

Abstract = {Cerebrovascular diseases are a public health and social policy priority
   in Europe due to their high prevalence and the long-term disability they
   may result in (as the principal cause of handicap). Increasingly, family
   caregivers take over the care at home of these patients. Two years
   post-stroke, our study analyzed the feelings of family caregivers from
   Luxembourg and northeastern Portugal toward their experience of
   caregiving and its repercussions on social and couple relationships,
   life satisfaction, and socioeconomic characteristics. Participating
   hospitals identified survivors and consent was sought by letter.
   Patients (n = 62) and their main caregivers (n = 46 pairs) were
   interviewed at home. The mean life satisfaction of caregivers was
   similar, but the experience of providing care differed in terms of
   family support, and disruptions of the caregivers' family
   responsibilities. More Portuguese respondents gave activities up, found
   little time for relaxation, and estimated that their health had
   deteriorated; more Luxembourgers felt strong enough to cope. More
   Portuguese spouses reported an impact on their sex lives. Family
   caregivers represent a ``population at risk.{''} Social workers can help
   them by providing domestic assistance, undertaking coaching activities,
   fostering favorable attitudes, and offering reassurance. Home-based
   rehabilitation in Europe involving family care must take account of
   cultural lifestyle issues.},

Abstract = {The objective of this cross-sectional study was to identify the factors
   associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of family
   caregivers of Chinese stroke patients. One hundred and twenty-three
   stroke patients consecutively admitted to a stroke clinic and their 123
   family caregivers were recruited. The caregivers' HRQOLs were assessed
   with the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Two subscores of the SF-36, the Physical
   Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary Scores served as the
   dependent variables. Independent variables comprised patients and
   caregivers' demographic data and physical and psychological conditions
   in relation to caregivers' HRQOL. The severity of coexisting illnesses
   of both the patients and their caregivers was assessed using the
   Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)
   was administered to rate both the patients and their caregivers'
   depressive symptoms. The extent of the patients' functional disability
   was assessed using the Barthel Index and the Instrumental Activities of
   Daily Living. Global cognition of the patients was measured using the
   Mini Mental State Examination. The level of social support and recent
   life events of the caregivers were rated using Lubben Social Network
   Scale and the Modified Life Event Scale, respectively. The multiple
   linear regression revealed caregivers' Cumulative Illness Rating Scale
   and GDS score were associated with Physical Component Summary Score of
   SF-36. The patients and caregivers' GDS score were associated with
   Mental Component Summary Score of SF-36. Severity of depressive symptoms
   in Chinese stroke patients and their caregivers is an important factor
   associated with the caregivers' HRQOL. Further studies evaluating
   interventions on caregivers' HRQOL should include the assessment and
   management of mood disorders. International Journal of Rehabilitation

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and
   features of low back pain (LBP) among stroke caregivers. Method:
   Participants included 64 caregivers of stroke survivors in our inpatient
   clinic. Age, gender, body weight, FIM (TM), and Brunnstrom Scale of
   patients and low back pain history, Short Form-36 (SF-36), Beck
   Depression Measure (BDM), and Oswestry Disability Scale (ODS) of
   caregivers were reported. Descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation,
   and Mann-Whitney U test were used. Results: Fifty-three (82.8 \%) of
   caregivers had LBP. Stroke survivors of caregivers with LBP (group 1)
   had significantly lower FIM (TM) scores when compared with stroke
   survivors of caregivers without LBP (group 2) (P < .05). All SF-36
   subscores and total score of group 1 except mental health were
   significantly lower than SF-36 scores of group 2. Discussion: The
   lifetime, 12-month period, and point prevalence of LBP were 44.1\%,
   34.0\%, and 19.7\%, respectively, in our country. Caregivers had a
   higher frequency of LBP in this study. However it was a study with a
   small number of participants. There are many studies about stroke
   caregivers' depression and life quality. LBP should also be
   investigated.},

Abstract = {More than 50\% of survivors of stroke (SSs) fall after discharge from
   the hospital, some of whom sustain significant injury. The purpose of
   this study was to explore SSs' and spousal caregivers' (CGs') lived
   experiences about falling and general mobility. Qualitative methods were
   used to perform a secondary analysis of interviews obtained from a
   larger study of 133 couples. Time, loss, and life changes emerged as
   themes in the qualitative analysis of expressers with ``keep stepping no
   matter what,{''} as the overarching theme. Number of SSs were examined
   for reports of falls and fall-related events. Of the 133 couples, 65
   were in the original study's intervention group. Sixty-six percent of
   the intervention group reported at least one fall, and 12\% of the
   intervention group and total study population sustained fall-related
   adverse events. Health care providers can learn from the experiences of
   SSs and CGs related to falling and mobility for enhanced discharge
   planning and fall prevention. Falling can cause injury in the SS or fear
   of falling of the SS, CG, or both.},

Abstract = {Even though stroke caregivers provide valuable care to loved ones, often
   sacrificing their own life goals and sometimes their health, they are
   frequently viewed by stroke professionals as irritants or problems.
   Medical training and medical bioethics literature focus almost
   exclusively on the physician-patient relationship, which leaves family
   members with uncertain standing. A family-centered approach allows
   providers to acknowledge and respect caregivers' needs without
   sacrificing patients' interests or authority.},

Abstract = {Caregiver burnout leads to a decline in caregivers' quality of life and
   in the quality of care they can deliver. A sample of 22 Stroke survivors
   and informal care givers from a 500-bed metropolitan teaching hospital
   were interviewed using a questionnaire. Pre- (at discharge) and post- (1
   month later) test scores were tested using Wilcoxon rank tests.
   Associations between activities of daily living and quality of life were
   tested with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Over the month,
   caregivers' scores for relationships, social companionship. and daily
   emotional Support decreased (but not significantly). Short hospital
   stays affected the recruitment for this study and contributed to
   problems for ward staff in implementing discharge plans. More innovative
   discharge planning is needed if caregivers' needs are to be met. (C)

   The aim of the study was to better understand caregivers' concerns about
   long-term implications of stroke and the caregiving role after
   completing the Preparedness Assessment for the Transition Home After
   Stroke (PATH-s). Design/Methods
   In this qualitative study, cognitive interviews were conducted with 20
   stroke caregivers who completed the PATH-s tool as part of an instrument
   validation study. Data were analyzed for salient themes related to their
   perceptions about stroke and the caregiving role. Findings
   Interviews yielded robust narrative data describing how the PATH-s items
   aided caregivers in recognizing potential issues and concerns about
   stroke and the caregiving role. Caregivers experienced uncertainty about
   the long-term stroke prognosis, which provoked anticipation and cues to
   action to begin addressing their concerns.},

Title = {Emotional and social repercussions of stroke on patient-family caregiver
   dyads: Analysis of diverging attitudes and profiles of the differing
   dyads},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {For patients, the social and emotional repercussions of stroke include
   shame, personality changes, and upheavals experienced by the couple
   (i.e. patient and main family caregiver). These impacts on the couple
   `patient/family caregiver' are scarcely documented. Focusing on the
   perceptions of the patients and the family caregivers living at home,
   two years after a stroke occurrence, the aims of the study were to
   analyse the concordance of attitudes towards the emotional and social
   repercussions of stroke and to determine the profiles of the differing
   dyads. Two researchers conducted separate face-to-face structured
   interviews with stroke survivors and their family caregivers. Eleven
   items, identified through a content analysis of interviews and after a
   qualitative process of generating questionnaire items, assessed the
   commonly experienced impact of stroke on the family, the social
   repercussions of stroke, and its emotional effects on the stroke
   survivors. The kappa concordance coefficient was used to determine the
   response convergence between patients and family caregivers. Four items,
   selected by a panel of experts, were included in logistic regressions
   (i.e., demographic characteristics and patients' impaired functions) to
   identify the differing dyadic profiles. Family caregivers' and patients'
   attitudes towards the social repercussions of stroke were similar.
   Patients with motor deficiencies tended to underestimate the upheaval
   brought to their couple by stroke, whereas caregivers of
   language-impaired patients tended to underestimate their feelings of
   shame and demeaning. Communication disturbances, but also residual
   physical disabilities in stroke survivors, may affect the understanding
   of each other's attitudes within dyads. In order to avoid dysfunctional
   relationships between family caregivers and patients, healthcare
   professionals need to pay special attention to this issue, especially in
   cases of aphasia and motor deficiencies.},

Title = {Mediating effects of burden on quality of life for caregivers of
   first-time stroke patients discharged from the hospital within one year},
Journal = {BMC NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden may be either a predictor or an outcome of
   caregiver quality of life (QoL). Patient or caregiver factors that
   directly affect caregiver QoL, predictors that are simultaneously shared
   with caregiver burden and QoL, and factors that affect caregiver QoL
   through caregiver burden are not well understood. This study explored
   predictors of caregiver QoL and identified whether caregiver burden is a
   mediator for caregivers of first-time stroke patients.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. We recruited first-time stroke
   patients who had been discharged from the hospital within 1 year. We
   screened caregivers with two major inclusion criteria: age > 20 years
   old and being the family member who provides the most patient care hours
   out of all family caregivers. Caregiver burden (Caregiver Strian Index,
   CSI), QoL (Caregiver Quality of Life Index, CQLI), and patient and
   caregiver characteristics were assessed with structured questionnaires.
   Multiple-regression and bootstrap analysis were conducted for data
   analysis.
   Results: A total of 126 caregivers completed the questionnaires. Higher
   caregiver burdens, lower caregiver education level, lower self-rated
   health, lower monthly family income, and spouses who were responsible
   for medical fees were significant predictors of lower caregiver QoL.
   Poor self-rated health and monthly family income of \$ 666 USD or below
   were the strongest predictors of caregiver QoL. Spouses who were
   responsible for medical fees and lower monthly family income had direct
   negative effects on caregiver QoL, but these factors exhibited no
   indirect mediating effect between caregiver characteristics and QoL
   through caregiver burden as a mediator. Caregiver education level at or
   below elementary school and poor or fair self-rated-health had direct
   negative effects on caregiver QoL, which were mediated by caregiver
   burden.
   Conclusions: Our study indicated predictors of caregiver QoL and the
   relationships with caregiver burden among first-time stroke survivors in
   the early stage. Caregivers' financial factors affected caregiver QoL
   directly. Caregivers' poor self-rated health and lower education level
   negatively affected caregiver QoL indirectly through caregiver burden as
   a mediator. Interventions to make appropriate policies for financial
   subsidies, to enhance caregivers' health and to provide tailored
   stroke-related education through multidisciplinary cooperation may
   effectively promote caregiver QoL.},

Abstract = {Introduction The aftermath of stroke leaves many consequences including
   cognitive deficits and falls due to imbalance. Stroke survivors and
   families struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system with little
   assistance posthospital discharge, often leading to early hospital
   readmission and worse stroke outcomes. Telemedicine Guided Education on
   Secondary Stroke and Fall Prevention Following Inpatient Rehabilitation
   feasibility study examines whether stroke survivors and their caregivers
   find value in telerehabilitation (TR) home visits that provide
   individualised care and education by a multidisciplinary team after
   discharge from inpatient rehabilitation.
   Methods and analysis A prospective, single arm, pilot study is designed
   to evaluate the feasibility of weekly TR home visits initiated
   postdischarge from inpatient rehabilitation. Newly diagnosed patients
   with stroke are recruited from a Houston-based comprehensive stroke
   centre inpatient rehabilitation unit, loaned an iPad with data plan and
   trained to use information technology security-approved
   videoconferencing application. After hospital discharge, six weekly TR
   home visits are led by rotating specialists (pharmacist,
   physical/occupational therapist, speech therapist, rehabilitation
   physician, social worker, geriatrician specialised in fracture
   prevention) followed by satisfaction survey on week 7. Specialists
   visually assess patients in real time, educate them on secondary stroke
   and fall prevention and suggest ways to improve function including
   direct medical interventions when indicated. Primary outcomes are
   proportion of eligible patients consenting to the study, participation
   rate in all six TR home visits and satisfaction score. The study started
   31 December 2015 with plan to enrol up to 50 patients over 24 months.
   Feasibility study results will inform us as to whether a randomised
   controlled trial is warranted to determine efficacy of TR home visit
   intervention in improving stroke outcomes.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval obtained by the Institutional
   Review Board (IRB), Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, IRB
   number: HSC-MS-14-0994. Study results will be submitted for publication
   in a peer-reviewed journal.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke affects the entire family system. Failure to meet the
   needs of caregivers leads to physical and mental overburdening. Stroke
   caregivers may benefit from professional support. The literature reviews
   have shown that there is still no clarity concerning the most
   appropriate set-up of a support programme. In Germany, there is no
   stroke caregiver support programme that operates throughout the course
   of rehabilitation.
   Aim: The aim was to develop a complex intervention programme for stroke
   caregivers in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany.
   Methods: A naturalistic enquiry approach, using a mixed-methods design,
   was applied. Within one overarching qualitative study, three separate,
   explorative, inductive, qualitative substudies were conducted: (i) seven
   explorative interviews with experienced stroke caregivers, (ii) six
   semi-structured interviews with professionals working within stroke
   rehabilitation and (iii) seventeen participant observations with focus
   on professional-caregiver interactions. Regional stroke units,
   rehabilitation centres, outpatient services and the home environment of
   caregivers were included. By means of a four-step qualitative content
   analysis, all three data sets were coded, categorised and subsequently
   condensed into subthemes, clustered into main themes, and finally
   translated into `Conceptual Building Blocks' of the programme.
   Results: The need for a personalised, holistic and multicomponent
   caregiver support programme emerged from all three substudies. Fourteen
   themes were condensed from the subthemes. Caregivers should be
   approached directly after stroke using outreach counselling. Support
   should be provided by a specially trained focal person across the entire
   patient's rehabilitation trajectory. The newly developed support
   programme consists of five flexible `Conceptual Building Blocks':
   Content, Human Resources, Personalised Approach, Timing and Setting.
   Conclusion: Through a qualitative mixed-methods design, an in-depth
   contextual understanding of stroke caregiver needs within the
   rehabilitative support system was reached. This allowed the development
   of a context tailored comprehensive caregiver support programme
   consisting of five `Conceptual Building Blocks'.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The current study aims to investigate the effects of
   primary caregiver participation in vestibular rehabilitation (VR) on
   improving the measures of neglect, activities of daily living (ADL),
   balance, and falls of unilateral neglect (UN) patients.
   Methods: This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Both
   experimental (n = 24) and control groups (n = 24) received conventional
   rehabilitation. The experimental group undertook VR for a month. During
   the first and second weeks, a registered nurse trained the experimental
   group in VR. The primary caregivers in the experimental group supervised
   and guided their patients in VR during the third and fourth weeks. The
   outcome measures were neglect, ADL, balance, and falls.
   Results: The two groups of UN patients showed a significant improvement
   in neglect, ADL, and balance over time. Based on the generalized
   estimating equations model, an interaction was observed between groups
   and times. Significant interactions were observed between the VR group
   at days 14 and 28 in the areas of neglect, ADL, and balance. No
   significant difference was observed between the two groups in the number
   of falls.
   Conclusion: Neglect, ADL, and balance among UN patients with right
   hemispheric stroke can be improved through the participation of primary
   caregivers in VR. Trained informal caregivers were recommended to
   provide VR guidance and supervision to patients who suffer from UN.},

Abstract = {To date, researchers have lacked a validated instrument to measure
   stroke caregivers' satisfaction with hospital care. We adjusted a
   validated patient version of satisfaction with hospital care for stroke
   caregivers and tested the 11-item caregivers' satisfaction with hospital
   care (C-SASC hospital scale) on caregivers of stroke patients admitted
   to nine stroke service facilities in the Netherlands. Stroke patients
   were identified through the stroke service facilities; caregivers were
   identified through the patients. We collected admission demographic data
   from the caregivers and gave them the C-SASC hospital scale. We tested
   the instrument by means of structural equation modeling and examined its
   validity and reliability. After the elimination of three items, the
   confirmatory factor analyses revealed good indices of fit with the
   resulting eight-item C-SASC hospital scale. Cronbach's alpha was high
   (0.85) and correlations with general satisfaction items with hospital
   care ranged from 0.594 to 0.594 (convergent validity). No significant
   relations were found with health and quality of life (divergent
   validity). Such results indicate strong construct validity. We conclude
   that the C-SASC hospital scale is a promising instrument for measuring
   stroke caregivers' satisfaction with hospital stroke care.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Understand the needs and feelings of the caregiver of
   individuals who have experienced a stroke, and identify the information
   provided to these caregivers by health professionals. Methods: This
   exploratory, descriptive qualitative approach used semistructured
   interviews to understand the experience of six caregivers, during the
   period from May to August, 2008. The data from these interviews were
   analyzed using discourse analysis. Results: Three categories were
   identified: the initial needs of the caregiver, the caregiver and
   his/her feelings, and the guidance received by the caregiver from health
   professionals. Needs of the caregivers were varied, but primarily
   concerned adaptive difficulties. Diverse feelings were identified,
   including ambivalence, and a range of intensity of those feelings was
   noted. Guidelines provided by health professionals ranged from a total
   absence of information, to guidance that was felt by caregivers to meet
   all of their needs. Conclusions: There is need for discussion regarding
   provision of standardized guidelines for caregivers, and a strategy to
   support caregivers and patients.},

Abstract = {Purpose/Objective: The purpose of this study was to create a set of
   culturally sensitive mental-health-intervention recommendations for the
   caregivers of Latino/Puerto-Rican, Black, and White individuals with
   stroke. The study examined whether the mental health of stroke
   caregivers and functioning of individuals with stroke differed according
   to race/ethnicity, changed differentially over time according to
   race/ethnicity, and showed relationships between the two sets of
   constructs that differed according to race/ethnicity. Research
   Method/Design: Data on caregiver mental health and functioning of
   individuals with stroke were collected from 124 (n = 248) White, Black,
   and Latino/Puerto-Rican dyads at 1, 6, and 12 months post-hospital
   discharge. Results: Out of the three racial/ethnic groups,
   Latino/Puerto-Rican individuals with stroke showed the lowest
   functioning, and their caregivers showed the poorest mental health,
   though the mental-health effects did not reach statistical significance.
   Consistent patterns which differed as a function of race/ethnicity
   emerged over time in the relationships between caregiver mental health
   and functioning of individuals with stroke. Conclusions/Implications:
   Critical knowledge may be lost regarding the connections between
   caregiver mental health and the functioning of individuals with stroke
   when researchers and clinicians look only across race/ethnicity as
   opposed to also within. A monolithic racial/ethnic approach to
   mental-health interventions for stroke rehabilitation is likely limited,
   and race/ethnicity may affect how caregiver mental health and
   functioning of individuals with stroke reciprocally influence each
   other.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine associations between cognitive appraisals (i.e.,
   negative appraisals about the self, negative appraisals about the world,
   and self-blame) and the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
   symptoms in informal caregivers (i.e., family relatives or close
   associates) of stroke survivors. Method: A cross-sectional study was
   conducted in which informal caregivers (N = 51) of recent stroke
   survivors completed the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale and the
   Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory Results: PTSD symptom severity
   correlated significantly with the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory
   Self, World, and Self-Blame subscales and with time since stroke and age
   (negative relationship). Cognitive appraisals explained 58\% of the
   variance in PTSD symptom severity. Conclusion: The associations found
   between negative cognitive appraisals and the severity of PTSD symptoms
   are consistent with current cognitive models of PTSD and the recommended
   use of trauma-related cognitive-behavioral therapy for individuals with
   PTSD.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The rehabilitation stage of a stroke survivor's recovery
   provides an opportunity to prepare family caregivers; for the supportive
   role they will play in the community. The goal of this qualitative study
   was to learn about family caregivers' experiences and support needs
   during the rehabilitation phase to inform program development. Method:
   We recruited family caregivers within the first 6 months post stroke.
   Nine caregivers participated in 40- to 60-minute in-depth qualitative
   interviews where the personal needs of caregivers were illuminated. Data
   were analyzed using content analysis. Results: An overriding theme was
   differences in personal needs between older and younger caregivers. We
   interviewed five younger caregivers (<= 55 years of age) and four older
   caregivers (>55 years of age). Younger caregivers; identified
   informational support and training as important parts of their social
   support whereas older caregivers did not. Younger caregivers were also
   more likely to complain or criticize the health care system and staff
   than older caregivers. A common theme among older caregivers was to
   focus on the importance of keeping a positive outlook throughout the
   experience. Conclusion: Caregiver experiences and support needs varied
   according to age. This suggests that support programs should consider
   age as a factor when tailoring interventions.},

Abstract = {Thirty-six caregivers of stroke survivors who are new to that role
   participate in a Web-based support and education intervention over the
   course of a year. The authors use a secondary analysis of a total of
   2,148 e-mail messages that these caregivers posted to the intervention's
   discussion group. Rigorous content analysis is used to analyze the
   narrative data coded to spirituality (n = 230 e-mails). Four themes
   emerge and are drawn to Friedemann's (1995) framework of systemic
   organization: (a) feeling the presence of a greater power, (b)
   practicing rituals, (c) being one with nature, and (d) interacting with
   family and friends. Spirituality gives these caregivers hope and
   sustenance, but it also helps them express themselves more fully during
   a difficult time of change. The e-mail discussion data presented here
   highlight the importance of increased awareness of addressing
   spirituality in nurse-client encounters and designing interventions to
   support the caregivers.},

Abstract = {Aim. This paper is a report of a study to identify family caregivers'
   needs and satisfaction levels in adult day healthcare services for older
   adults with stroke.
   Background. With a growing number of older people suffering from chronic
   illnesses, the demand for adult day care is growing worldwide. However,
   in Asia, caregivers face unique challenges in selecting and using
   culturally acceptable models of care for older people with stroke, and
   there are still unmet needs in adult day healthcare services.
   Method. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was carried out in 2006
   with a convenience sample of 119 family caregivers from nine centres in
   Korea. The questionnaire included the Modified Caregiver Satisfaction
   Scale.
   Findings. Korean family caregivers of older people with stroke were
   moderately satisfied with the adult day healthcare services. In
   particular, health management was an area with a high level of needs but
   with a low level of satisfaction. Respondents also had unmet needs such
   as speech therapy, patient-tailored exercise and physical therapy. There
   was a statistically significant difference in degree of satisfaction
   according to whether or not Registered Nurses delivered care at the
   centres.
   Conclusion. It is important to reflect family caregivers' needs by
   providing quality care, which is culture-specific adult day healthcare
   services and focuses on health management and skilled nursing care.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the
   United States. Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver
   assistance. Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely
   related to patients' health outcomes. The timing of this study
   intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019
   (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital
   visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research
   question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by
   caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient
   rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the
   caregiver experience?
   Methods: Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation
   facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and
   then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators
   used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze
   qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized
   before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes.
   Results: Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes
   across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the
   caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver
   experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor
   policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers.
   Discussion and Conclusions: Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and
   frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved
   caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient
   rehabilitation. This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. If visitation for multiple therapy
   sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep
   the caregiver involved in the plan of care.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Informal caregiving of stroke survivors often begins with
   intensity compared with the linear caregiving trajectories in
   progressive conditions. Informal caregivers of stroke survivors are
   often inadequately prepared for their caregiving role, which can have
   detrimental effects on their well-being. A greater depth of
   understanding about caregiving burden is needed to identify caregivers
   in most need of intervention. The purpose of this study was to examine
   caregiver burden and associated factors among a cohort of informal
   caregivers of stroke survivors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 88
   informal caregivers of stroke survivors was completed. Caregiver burden
   was determined with the Zarit Burden Interview, caregiver depressive
   symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and
   stroke survivor functional disability was assessed with the Barthel
   Index. Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify independent
   factors associated with caregiver burden. RESULTS: Forty-three informal
   caregivers (49\%) reported minimal or no caregiver burden, 30 (34\%)
   reported mild to moderate caregiver burden, and 15 (17\%) reported
   moderate to severe caregiver burden. Stroke survivor functional
   disability was associated with informal caregiver burden (P = .0387).
   The odds of having mild to moderate caregiver burden were 3.7 times
   higher for informal caregivers of stroke survivors with moderate to
   severe functional disability than for caregivers of stroke survivors
   with no functional disability. The presence of caregiver depressive
   symptoms was highly correlated with caregiver burden (P < .001).
   CONCLUSION: Caregivers of stroke survivors with functional disabilities
   and caregivers experiencing depressive symptoms may have severer
   caregiver burden. Trials of interventions aimed at decreasing informal
   caregiver burden should consider the potential impact of stroke
   survivors' functional disability and the presence of depressive
   symptoms.},

Abstract = {Introduction and aim: Many caregivers of stroke patients experience a
   high burden. This study aims to describe the course of burden in
   individual caregivers in the first year after stroke. Methods: This
   study is part of the Stroke Cohort Outcomes of REhabilitation study, a
   multicentre, longitudinal cohort study including consecutive stroke
   patients admitted to two rehabilitation facilities. Caregivers were
   asked to complete the Caregiver Strain Index and questions on their
   sociodemographic characteristics 6 and 12 months post admission.
   Patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were extracted
   from medical records. Results: A total of 129 caregivers were included,
   72 completed the Caregiver Strain Index twice. Of them, 19 (26.4\%) were
   men, median age 59 (range 27-78) years. A consistently high or low
   burden was reported by 15 (20.8\%) and 49 (68.1\%), respectively,
   whereas 8 (11.1\%) reported a high burden at either 6 (n = 3) or 12
   months (n = 5). Discussion: In the majority of caregivers of stroke
   patients the perceived caregiver burden is consistent over time.
   However, as in 11.1\% caregiver burden changes from 6 to 12 months,
   caregiver burden should be measured repeatedly until 12 months after
   stroke. Caregivers living together with a patient who suffered a
   haemorrhagic stroke seem to be more at risk for a high burden.},

Abstract = {Background: Family caregivers (CGs) are critical to the care and
   recovery of stroke survivors (SSs), particularly in the community.
   However, little is known about their psychosocial well-being, especially
   in developing countries. In this study, we assessed CG burden,
   psychiatric morbidity, quality of life (QoL), and predictors of burden.
   Materials and Methods: We recruited 150 dyads of CGs/SSs from two
   outpatient clinics in Nigeria. Data were collected through
   sociodemographic/clinical questionnaire, the Zarit caregiver burden
   interview, the World Health Organization QoL-BREF, and the
   Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Disability in SSs was
   graded with the Modified Rankin Scale.
   Results: Compared to CGs who were mostly females (86.7\%) with a mean
   age of 42.8 (+/- 12.6) years, SSs were older with a mean age of 61.6
   (+/- 12.5) years and were mainly males (62.7\%). The mean CG burden
   score was 31.6 (+/- 10.5) and eight in 10 CGs, 124 (82.7\%) reported
   moderate-to-severe burden scores. Mental disorders in the form of
   depression and/or anxiety disorders were diagnosed in 26 (17.3\%) CGs.
   Significant predictors of high-burden scores (P < 0.05) were
   incontinence in SSs, psychological symptoms in SS, worse poststroke
   disability, and performance of more CG tasks (B = 8.3, 4.5, 3.9, and
   3.5, respectively). CGs QoL scores correlated negatively with burden
   scores, with medium-to-large effect sizes (r = -0.4--0.6) across QoL
   spheres.
   Conclusion: In this study, psychosocial burden in CGs was indexed by
   various determinants and impacted QoL negatively. Given the integral
   role of CGs to the care of SSs in the community, mental health services,
   psychosocial support programs, and stratification based on known
   vulnerability factors seems viable options for intervention, assessment,
   and planning.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of home care provided
   for stroke patients and education of caregivers on the caregiver burden
   and quality of life. The study was conducted by using a true
   experimental method with pre-test and post-test control group. The study
   included 43 experimental and 43 control patients and their caregivers.
   The Patient and Caregiver Description Form, Patient Problem Identifying
   Form, Caregiving Burden Scale and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale were used
   to collect data in the study. Nursing care was provided to the
   experimental group patients according to the model of daily living
   activities, while their caregivers received training and consultancy. In
   the control group, there was no such intervention. Percentage
   distribution, chi(2), independent sample t-test, paired t-test,
   Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used on
   statistical analyses. There was no significant difference in pre-test
   score means between experimental and control group caregivers. However,
   a statistically significant difference was found in all sub-dimensions
   of the quality of life scale between pre-test and post-test score means
   in the experimental group caregivers. This study results indicated that
   home care provided for stroke patients and education of caregivers
   decreased the caregiver burden and increased their quality of life.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Drawing on the perspectives of stroke survivors, family members
   and domestic helpers, this study explores participants' experiences of
   self-perceived fall risk factors after stroke, common fall prevention
   strategies used, and challenges to community participation after a fall.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Singapore with
   community-dwelling stroke survivors with a previous fall (n = 9), family
   caregivers (n = 4), and domestic helpers (n = 4) who have cared for a
   stroke survivor with a previous fall. Purposive sampling was used for
   recruitment; all interviews were audio-recorded with permission and
   transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo (v10) software.
   Results: All participants shared their self-perceived intrinsic and
   extrinsic fall risk factors and main challenges after a fall. For stroke
   participants and family caregivers, motivational factors in developing
   safety strategies after a previous fall(s) include social connectedness,
   independent living and community participation. For family caregivers
   and domestic helpers, the stroke survivor's safety is their top
   priority, however this can also lead to over-protective behavior outside
   of the rehabilitation process. Conclusions: Reducing the risk of falls
   in community-dwelling stroke survivors seems to be more important than
   promoting community participation among caregivers. The study findings
   highlight that a structured and client-centered fall prevention program
   targeting stroke survivors and caregivers is needed in Singapore.},

Abstract = {Aim The aim of this study was to assess the caregiver burden over time
   of patients with haemorrhagic stroke and the determinants of this.
   Background Identification of the predictors for caregiver burden can be
   used to improve the outcomes of stroke survivors and caregivers. Few
   studies focus on the caregiver burden of patients with haemorrhagic
   stroke and how this changes over time. Design This was a prospective
   longitudinal study. Methods A convenience sample of 202 stroke
   survivor/caregiver pairs were recruited in the neurosurgery unit from
   March 2015 to March 2016. The participants were assessed at three
   different times by face to face or telephone interview. Caregiver burden
   was assessed using the Bakas Caregiver Outcomes Scale. Sociodemographic
   data and other characteristics of the pairs were also collected.
   Multiple linear regression was performed to identify the determinants.
   Results Caregiver burden decreased from T1 to T3 significantly. The
   physical function, depression of stroke survivors, and self-rated burden
   of caregivers were the most important determinants for overall caregiver
   burden. The factors identified explained 41.6\% to 67.4\% of overall
   burden. Conclusion Caregiver burden decreased over time, affected by
   factors from patients and caregivers. More professional caregivers are
   needed to support informal carers.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Return to work is an issue of concern for stroke survivors
   and their spouses. Ramifications may include loss of income and
   self-efficacy.
   OBJECTIVE: This study describes the return to work patterns of stroke
   survivors and their spousal caregivers post stroke.
   METHODS: One hundred fifty-nine dyads were examined for their return to
   work patterns at baseline (post hospital discharge) and then at 3 month
   intervals for one year. Relationships were determined between work and
   gender, age, ethnicity, education, type of insurance, type of stroke,
   location of stroke, motor and cognitive functional status, depression,
   mutuality, and life satisfaction.
   RESULTS: Low levels of return to work by stroke survivors (7.5\%) and a
   small decrease in the amount of working caregivers (from 45.3\% to
   40.35\%) were found one year post baseline. Variables that predicted
   return to work changed over the five data points except for younger age
   for the caregiver, which was consistently significant across all data
   points. Three case scenarios representative of working patterns are
   offered.
   CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed regarding the return to work
   needs of stroke survivors and their spousal caregivers, particularly
   what role the occupational therapist may play in facilitating that
   process.},

Abstract = {Rationale Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability in rural
   China. For stroke patients residing in resource-limited rural areas,
   secondary prevention and rehabilitation are largely unavailable, and
   where present, are far below evidence-based standards.
   Aim This study aims to develop and implement a simplified stroke
   rehabilitation program that utilizes nurses and family caregivers for
   service delivery, and evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness in
   rural China.
   Methods and design This 2-year randomized controlled trial is being
   conducted in 2-3 county hospitals located in northwest, northeast, and
   southwest China. Eligible and consenting stroke inpatients (200 in
   total) have been recruited and randomized into either a control or
   intervention group. Nurses in the county hospital are trained by
   rehabilitation specialists and in turn train the family caregivers in
   the intervention group. They also provide telephone follow-up care three
   times post discharge. The recruitment, baseline, intervention, follow-up
   care, and evaluation are guided by the RECOVER mobile phone app
   specifically designed for this study.
   Study outcome The primary outcome is patients' Barthel Index (activities
   of daily living: mobility, self-care, and toileting) at 6 months.
   Process and economic evaluation will also be conducted.
   Discussion The results of our study will generate initial high-quality
   evidence to improve stroke care in resource-scarce settings. If proven
   effective, this innovative care delivery model has the potential to
   improve the health and function of stroke patients, relieve caregiver
   burden, guide policy-making, and advance translational research in the
   field of stroke care.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the relationship between family functioning and
   depression in primary caregivers of stroke survivors in China.
   Design: Baseline cross-sectional data from an intervention study for
   stroke survivors and their families were used.
   Setting: Neurology inpatient service of a large urban hospital.
   Participants: Stroke survivors (n = 180), each with a primary caregiver,
   were enrolled in this study. The mean age of stroke survivors was 65.60
   years, and the mean age of primary caregivers was 57.60 years.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Methods: The Family Assessment Device (FAD) and Center for Epidemiologic
   Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively, were used.
   Results: Following a stroke of a family member, 71\% of caregivers
   experienced depressive symptoms. Higher depression severity in
   caregivers was linked to caregiver education, stroke survivor ADLs, and
   family functioning.
   Conclusion: Assessment of family functioning may help determine which
   caregivers are most at risk for developing depressive syndrome.

Title = {A process evaluation of a stroke-specific follow-up care model for
   stroke patients and caregivers; a longitudinal study},
Journal = {BMC NURSING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Abstract = {Background: There is a need for follow-up care after stroke, but there
   is no consensus about the way to organise it. An intervention providing
   follow-up care for stroke patients and caregivers showed favourable
   effects on the level of social activities, but no other effects were
   found. The intervention consists of a maximum of five home visits to
   patients and caregivers during a period of 18 months post-discharge. The
   home visits are conducted by a stroke care coordinator (SCC) using a
   structured assessment tool. The objective of this study was to examine
   process-related factors that could have influenced the effectiveness of
   the intervention.
   Methods: 77 stroke patients, 59 caregivers and 4 SCCs participated in
   the study. Data on the organisational characteristics of and the
   satisfaction with the intervention were collected by means of structured
   assessments, interviews and self-administered questionnaires at 1, 6, 12
   and 18 months of follow-up. The intervention was provided between April
   2008 and June 2011.
   Results: Patients received an average of 3.8 home visits (SD 1.4) and
   55\% of them had a follow-up period of a maximum of 18 months. There
   were 1074 problems identified and the SCCs initiated 363 follow-up care
   and referral options. Stroke patients and caregivers were very satisfied
   with the intervention. The SCCs were satisfied with the assessment tool,
   but would like to see a structured referral system.
   Conclusions: The intervention was only partially performed in accordance
   with the protocol and was positively evaluated by patients, caregivers
   and SCCs. It is recommended to add a structured referral system to the
   intervention.},

Title = {The Stroke Caregiver Unmet Resource Needs Scale: Development and

Abstract = {The purposes of this study were to develop and validate a measure of
   unmet resource needs of the caregivers of survivors of stroke and to
   describe the caregivers' unmet needs during 1 year. A longitudinal,
   descriptive design was used to test the reliability and validity of the
   Unmet Resource Needs (URN) measure. Item development was based on
   literature review and preliminary study findings. A stress and coping
   conceptual model framed the hypotheses. Psychometric testing was based
   on 6-month postdischarge data (n = 166). Content and structural
   construct validity, internal consistency reliability through 1 year, and
   concurrent validity were tested. Change in URN over time was examined.
   Content validity was supported by floor and ceiling effects less than
   5\%. Principal axis factoring yielded a 12-item, two-factor solution
   reflecting general and technology unmet needs. Internal consistency
   reliability was satisfactory for the total scale and subscales at all
   times, excepting the baseline three-item technology scale ( = .56).
   Concurrent validity was supported by significant correlations with model
   constructs (threat, positive problem solving, depression, preparedness;
   p < .01) in the expected direction. Functional status and resource use
   were not associated with the URN. Repeated measures analysis of variance
   (n = 123) indicated a significant decrease in unmet needs from baseline
   to 3, 6, and 12 months postdischarge (p < .001). Nevertheless, 42\%
   reported one or more unmet needs at year 1. Assessment and counseling on
   unmet needs is indicated throughout the caregiving trajectory to reduce
   negative outcomes.},

Abstract = {Poststroke depression is common but remains underdiagnosed and
   undertreated. One explanation for this is that depressive symptoms go
   unrecognized by stroke survivors and their family caregivers and thus go
   unreported to the stroke survivor's healthcare provider. Forty-four
   stroke survivor-informal caregiver dyads were interviewed using a
   depression knowledge scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
   Depression Scale, and an adapted version of the Revised Illness
   Perception Questionnaire to determine their lay knowledge of depressive
   symptoms, recognition of poststroke depressive symptoms, and perception
   of the recognized symptoms. Caregivers and stroke survivors had moderate
   knowledge of depressive symptoms but had some misconceptions. The most
   commonly recognized poststroke depressive symptoms by stroke survivors
   were ``feeling like everything was an effort,'' ``restless sleep,''
   ``difficulty concentrating,'' and ``talking less than usual.''
   Caregivers identified that the stroke survivor was ``feeling like
   everything was an effort,'' had ``restless sleep,'' ``felt sad,'' and
   ``felt depressed.'' Three quarters of stroke survivors with high levels
   of depressive symptoms identified the cluster of symptoms as potentially
   being depression. Neuroscience nurses are in the unique position to
   educate stroke survivors and their caregivers about poststroke
   depressive symptoms, treatment options, and the importance of discussing
   depressive symptoms with their healthcare provider.},

Abstract = {After discharge from hospital most stroke patients are being cared for
   by relatives. In the majority of cases it does mean long-term demands
   for relatives and often it has also an effect on their health. There is
   a variety of possibilities for offering support to relatives in
   accomplishing their tasks and thus contribute to a relief of burden.
   There has not yet been enough research investigating how various
   intervention concepts really meet the needs of the relatives and how
   effective the interventions reduce the burden of the caregivers. Five
   types of intervention concepts for supporting relatives of stroke
   patients can be differentiated so far: special services, training,
   counselling, social support through other caregivers and multi-component
   interventions. On the basis of 42 intervention studies an attempt is
   being made to give a preliminary statement about the effectiveness of
   intervention models. The multi-component interventions combined with
   psychotherapeutic strategies seem to emerge as a recommendable concept.},

Abstract = {Study Aim: Preliminary, descriptive analysis of accidents in a
   convenience sample of older spousal caregivers of persons surviving
   stroke. Sample: 124 spousal caregivers of persons surviving stroke,
   primarily White women with more than a high school education, average
   age of 69.88 years, and average time caregiving of 2.61 years. Results:
   30\% incidence rate of self-reported accidents over a 6-month period,
   ranging from minor to potentially serious. Female gender, longer time
   caregiving, greater burden in the form of personal strain, and
   depression were predictive of report of accidents in logistic regression
   analysis. Conclusion: Accidents should be included in studies assessing
   caregiver health. Evidence of injury in family caregivers can signal
   distress and vulnerability that could inform interventions to reduce
   stress.},

Abstract = {Purpose The study purpose was to develop a measure to assess stroke
   caregivers' commitment and capacity to assume the caregiving role prior
   to discharge. Design Participants were caregivers of stroke survivors in
   an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Methods A sequential, multimethod
   approach, which included item generation from qualitative data, review
   of items by expert clinicians, cognitive interviews to determine
   response format (n= 22), and item clarity (n= 20), and an analysis of
   pilot data were utilized. Findings Cognitive interviewing provided
   information to improve item clarity. Conclusion This instrument
   development approach resulted in the Preparedness Assessment for the
   Transition Home After Stroke (PATH-s), a 26-item self-report instrument.
   The PATH-s represents the domains of theModel of Caregiver Readiness,
   upon which the instrument was developed.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose- Persistent depression after ischemic stroke is
   common in stroke survivors and may be even higher in family caregivers,
   but few studies have examined depressive symptom levels and their
   predictors in patient and caregiver groups simultaneously. Methods-
   Stroke survivors and their family caregivers (205 dyads) were enrolled
   from the national REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial
   Differences in Stroke) into the CARES study (Caring for Adults
   Recovering from the Effects of Stroke) approximate to 9 months after a
   first-time ischemic stroke. Demographically matched stroke-free dyads
   (N=205) were also enrolled. Participants were interviewed by telephone,
   and depressive symptoms were assessed with the 20-item Center for
   Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Results- Significant
   elevations in depressive symptoms (Ps<0.03) were observed for stroke
   survivors (M=8.38) and for their family caregivers (M=6.42) relative to
   their matched controls (Ms=5.18 and 4.62, respectively). Stroke
   survivors reported more symptoms of depression than their caregivers
   (P=0.008). No race or sex differences were found, but differential
   prediction of depressive symptom levels was found across patients and
   caregivers. Younger age and having an older caregiver were associated
   with more depressive symptoms in stroke survivors while being a spouse
   caregiver and reporting fewer positive aspects of caregiving were
   associated with more depressive symptoms in caregivers. The percentage
   of caregivers at risk for clinically significant depression was lower in
   this population-based sample (12\%) than in previous studies of
   caregivers from convenience or clinical samples. Conclusions- High
   depressive symptom levels are common 9 months after first-time ischemic
   strokes for stroke survivors and family caregivers, but rates of
   depressive symptoms at risk for clinical depression were lower for
   caregivers than previously reported. Predictors of depression differ for
   patients and caregivers, and standards of care should incorporate family
   caregiving factors.},

Abstract = {Aim We assessed the burden and experiences of caregivers looking after
   stroke patients in Kampala, Uganda. Design We conducted a qualitative
   cross-sectional study between May 2018-July 2018 among primary
   caregivers of stroke patients. Methods The primary caregiver was defined
   as the person spending most of the time providing daily care for the
   stroke patient for at least four months. Purposive sampling was used to
   consecutively recruit the primary caregivers. In-depth interviews were
   conducted, and audiotape recorded, and observations were also made. Data
   were managed using NVIVO 12.0 following thematic approach. Results
   Twenty-five caregivers were included in the analysis with a mean age of
   39.3, SD 10.7. Four themes were identified from the qualitative analysis
   on caregivers' experiences of looking after stroke patients: taking on
   new responsibilities, factors that protected caregivers from breaking
   down, limited resources and experiences with patient outcomes. Our
   findings highlight the need for interventions to support stroke patients
   and their caregivers.},

Abstract = {Background: Modern therapeutics and health care improvements prolong
   stroke patients' survival; however, the degree of disability remains
   high. Stroke survivors often require caregivers, particularly in the
   first year after the onset of the stroke. Longitudinal assessment of and
   factors associated with caregiver burden (CGB) among caregivers of
   stroke patients has been scarcely discussed. This study aimed to define
   the changes in CGB in the first year of caregiving among the caregivers
   of stroke patients and to identify associated factors.
   Methods: A prospective, multi-centered observational study was conducted
   in nine public hospitals in Mongolia. We used the Montgomery CGB Scale
   for assessing CGB, and repeated the assessment after 1 year. Stroke
   patient characteristics were included in the analyses. Multinomial
   logistic regressions were conducted to analyze changes in CGB.
   Results: A paired t-test analysis revealed that demand burden increased
   (from 12.61 to 11.50, p = 0.034), whereas stress burden decreased (from
   10.69 to 11.60, p = 0.016). Although objective burden decreased, the
   difference was not significant. Factors associated with these changes in
   CGB were the caregiver's marital status, the caregiver's relationship
   with the patient, financial difficulties, and the patient's sex and
   dependency.
   Discussion: The information on factors predicting changes in CGB in the
   first year of caregiving provided in this study suggests that social or
   financial support can assist in reducing CGB among the caregivers of
   post-stroke patients.},

Title = {Stroke survivors', caregivers' and GPs' attitudes towards a polypill for
   the secondary prevention of stroke: a qualitative interview study},

Abstract = {Objectives To understand the perspectives of stroke survivors,
   caregivers and general practitioners (GPs) on a polypill approach,
   consisting of blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering therapies, with or
   without aspirin, for the secondary prevention of stroke.
   Methods A qualitative interview study was undertaken in 5 GP surgeries
   in the East of England. 28 survivors of stroke/transient ischaemic
   attack (TIA) were interviewed, 14 of them with a caregiver present,
   along with a convenience sample of 5 GPs, to assess attitudes towards a
   polypill and future use. Topic guides explored participants attitudes,
   potential uptake and long-term use, management of polypill medication
   and factors influencing the decision to prescribe. Data were analysed
   using a grounded theory approach. Key themes are presented and
   illustrated with verbatim quotes.
   Results The analysis identified 3 key themes: polypill benefits,
   polypill concerns and polypill lessons for implementation. Stroke/TIA
   survivors were positive about the polypill concept and considered it
   acceptable in the secondary prevention of stroke. Perceived benefits of
   a polypill included convenience resulting in improved adherence and
   reduced burden of treatment. Caregivers felt that a polypill would
   improve medication-taking practices, and GPs were open to prescribing it
   to those at increased cardiovascular risk. However, concerns raised
   included whether a polypill provided equivalent therapeutic benefit,
   side effects through combining medications, consequences of
   non-adherence, lack of flexibility in regulating dosage, disruption to
   current treatment and suitability to the wider stroke population.
   Conclusions Participants acknowledged potential advantages in a polypill
   approach for secondary prevention of stroke; however, significant
   concerns remain. Further research on the efficacy of a polypill is
   needed to reassure practitioners whose concerns around inflexibility and
   treatment suitability are likely to influence the decision to prescribe
   a polypill for secondary prevention of stroke. Acceptability among
   survivors, caregivers and GPs is likely to determine the uptake and
   subsequent use of a polypill in the future.},

Abstract = {Aims and objectivesThis study identified the factors that affect
   health-related quality of life at one and six months post-stroke in
   women who have undergone a mild stroke and that affect their informal
   caregivers' psychological health status.
   BackgroundMiddle-aged women perform the main care roles in a family.
   When they suffer a stroke, it upsets the equilibrium of their family
   life.
   DesignThis is a longitudinal design.
   MethodsThis prospective follow-up study recruited 41 middle-aged women
   stroke survivors (mean age=54.95, SD=9.63) and their informal caregivers
   (mean age=41.56, SD=15.93). The Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was
   used to assess stroke survivor's health-related quality of life, and the
   Chinese Health Questionnaire was used to measure the level of depression
   of the stroke survivor's informal caregiver. Data were analysed through
   descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and the generalised
   estimating equation approach for modelling repeatedly measures.
   ResultsAll stroke survivors showed significant improvement in the
   physical component summary of the health-related quality of life at one
   and six months after stroke, but there was no significant difference in
   the mental component summary. In addition, there was no significant
   difference in the health of the informal caregivers of the women over
   time. Generalised estimating equation analysis showed that the most
   important determinant of mental component summary of health-related
   quality of life among women stroke survivors was cognitive appraisal.
   The informal caregivers' most important determinants of health status,
   as measured by level of depression, were their sense of coherence,
   burden and patients' mental component summary of the health-related
   quality of life.
   ConclusionThis study highlights the impact of cognitive appraisal in
   determining health-related quality of life of women stroke survivors and
   how it affects their caregivers' mental health.
   Relevance to clinical practiceThe findings of this study may contribute
   to home care nurses' understanding the importance of the psychosocial
   impact of the stroke for the survivor and their ability to help the
   surviving women to promote the confidence needed for self-care, which
   will contribute to their quality of life and affect their caregivers'
   health.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the content and delivery of the adapted London
   Stroke Carers Training Course intervention evaluated in the Training
   Caregivers after Stroke (TRACS) trial.
   Setting: The London Stroke Carers Training Course is a structured
   training programme for caregivers of inpatients who are likely to return
   home after their stroke. The course was delivered by members of the
   multidisciplinary team while the patient was in the stroke unit with one
   recommended `follow through' session after discharge home.
   Intervention: The intervention consists of 14 training components (six
   mandatory) that were identified as important knowledge/skills that
   caregivers would need to be able to care for the stroke patient after
   discharge home. Following national training days, the London Stroke
   Carers Training Course was disseminated to intervention sites by the
   cascade method of implementation.
   Results: The intervention was adapted for implementation across a range
   of stroke units. Training days were well attended (median 2.5 and 2.0
   attendees per centre for the first and second days, respectively) and
   the feedback positive, demonstrating `face validity' for the
   intervention. However cascading of this training to other members of the
   multidisciplinary team was not consistent, with 7/18 centres recording
   no cascade training.
   Conclusion: The adapted London Stroke Carers Training Course provided a
   training programme that could be delivered in a standardised, structured
   way in a variety of stroke unit settings throughout the UK. The
   intervention was well received by stroke unit staff, however, the
   cascade method of implementation was not as effective as we would have
   wished.},

Abstract = {Objective: Caregivers play an important role in the wellbeing of stroke
   patients, and are known to experience considerable strain 3 months or
   more after patient discharge. The aim of this study was to determine the
   prevalence and determinants of caregiver strain early after discharge.
   Methods: Six weeks after discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation
   setting stroke-surviving patients and their caregivers were seen by a
   specialized nurse. Several screening lists, including the Caregiver
   Strain Index (CSI), were completed. Step-wise logistic regression was
   used to analyse which determinants independently contribute to caregiver
   strain.
   Results: A total of 284 stroke-surviving patients were included in the
   study. Of the 179 caregivers who completed the CSI, 23 (12.8\%)
   experienced considerable strain. A higher level of anxiety symptoms and
   lower life satisfaction in patients are independently associated with
   higher caregiver strain (p=0.000007 and p=0.0031, respectively).
   Conclusion: High strain is experienced by 12.8\% of caregivers shortly
   after discharge of a stroke-surviving patient. More anxiety symptoms and
   lower life satisfaction in patients are independently associated with a
   higher level of strain in caregivers. Treating patient anxiety at an
   early stage might therefore lead to a decrease in long-term caregiver
   strain.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Patients with stroke suffer from physical disabilities,
   followed by mental instability. Their caregivers also suffer from mental
   instability. The present study attempted to address the degree and the
   change of the level of Purpose in Life (PIL) in patients with stroke and
   caregivers by applying art therapy using colors. Materials and Methods:
   Twenty-eight stroke patients with a good functional recovery or a
   moderate disability and their 28 caregivers were selected and evaluated.
   The period of the study between the stroke and color therapy was more
   than 6 months. Patients and caregivers were divided into the color
   therapy (28) and control groups (28). A questionnaire, which measures
   the level of Pit was conducted separately for patients and caregivers
   prior to the first session of color therapy (2 hours per week, total 16
   sessions). The final examination was performed 5 months after the last
   color therapy session. Results: There was significant difference between
   before and after color therapy when the level of Pit was measured both
   in patients and caregivers (p<0.01). These were the same between the
   color therapy group, compared with the control group (p<0.01). As color
   therapy progressed to the late phase, patients and caregivers applied
   increasing number of colors and color intensity. Conclusion: These
   results prove that color therapy will improve Pit of the patients with
   post-stroke disability and caregivers. Furthermore, color therapy would
   be a useful adjuvant for improving the quality of life of the patients
   with stroke and their caregivers.},

Abstract = {The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the
   socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with depressive
   symptoms in the family caregivers of Hong Kong Chinese stroke patients.
   One hundred and twenty-three patients at a stroke clinic and their
   family caregivers formed the study sample. The depressive symptoms of
   both the patients and their family caregivers were rated with the
   Chinese version of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
   Participants' socio-demographic data and clinical characteristics served
   as the independent variables in relation to the caregivers' GDS scores.
   Patients' and caregivers' somatic and psychological conditions were
   measured with 10 scales. In univariate analysis, caregivers' GDS scores
   were significantly correlated with certain of their characteristics
   {[}Modified Life Event Scale (MLES), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale
   (CIRS) and Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) scores, sex and being a
   housewife] and those of the patients (GDS score and being a housewife).
   Multiple regression analysis showed caregivers' MLES and CIRS scores and
   patients' GDS scores to be independent correlates of caregivers' GDS
   scores. Adverse events encountered by caregivers in the past 6 months,
   their current health problems and patients' depressive symptoms were
   found to be the principal factors associated with caregivers' depressive

Title = {Seeking harmony in the provision of care to the stroke-impaired: views
   of Chinese family caregivers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING},

Abstract = {Aims.
   To explore the coping strategies of Chinese family caregivers of
   stroke-impaired older relatives.
   Background.
   Many stroke-impaired patients rely heavily on support from their
   families, and the daily lives of such family caregivers are severely
   impacted. However, services and support for family caregivers of
   stroke-impaired relatives in the home setting have received little
   attention. Appropriate and relevant information and support to family
   caregivers are important in facilitating the care-giving task. It is,
   therefore, necessary to understand the nature and demands of care-giving
   before planning specific educational and support programmes.
   Design.
   Grounded theory.
   Methods.
   Fifteen Chinese family caregivers of stroke-impaired older relatives
   were recruited and interviewed in 2003 and 2004. Theoretical sampling
   and constant comparative analysis were used to recruit the sample and
   perform data analysis.
   Results.
   Seeking harmony to provide care for the stroke-impaired was the core
   category for describing and guiding the family care-giving process, with
   five main stages: (1) living with ambiguity, (2) monitoring the recovery
   progress, (3) accepting the downfalls, (4) meeting family obligations
   and (5) reconciling with harmony. These issues were seldom discussed
   openly with health professionals.
   Conclusions.
   The findings indicated that Chinese family caregivers determine their
   own needs by seeking harmony to continue to provide care without
   thinking about getting help from others or their own health problems.
   These findings help to define some of the complex dynamics that have an
   impact on the development of partnership care and might challenge nurses
   practising in the community.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   Community nurses should assess and understand the coping strategies of
   family caregivers and assist them to engage in stress-reducing
   practices. This is an important partnership to be formed in stroke care
   for family caregivers in the community. The study findings will guide
   further development of family care-giving aspects in nursing practice.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the current study was to investigate the contribution of
   caregivers' characteristics to health service utilization by minority
   persons with first episode stroke. Participants were 61 primary
   caregivers of minority persons (41\% African American; 59\% Hispanic)
   with first episode symptomatic stroke consecutively admitted to an
   inpatient rehabilitation unit at a county hospital. Caregiver
   characteristics included resources for daily living, general health,
   social support, and health beliefs. Health service utilization was
   defined as the percentage of medical and therapy appointments attended
   for the first 6 months following discharge from inpatient
   rehabilitation. There was no difference in percentage of appointments
   attended between African American and Hispanic caregivers. There was a
   significant difference between caregivers on the External Control by
   Powerful Others subscale of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control
   Scale (MHLC), with Hispanic caregivers reporting a greater belief that
   powerful others exerted control over their health. There was a trend for
   Hispanics to score higher on the External Control by Chance subscale of
   the MHLC. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that persons
   with stroke were less likely to attend appointments if their caregiver
   believed that health was related to chance factors. These results
   suggest that caregiver health beliefs play an important role in patient
   adherence to medical recommendations. Education of caregivers may result
   in improved follow-through with medical recommendations.},

Abstract = {Background: A vast body of research has shown that the emotional and
   physical demands of caregiving may lead to increased stress and burden.
   However, it is unknown whether these factors are associated with
   increased risk for injuries among caregivers. Purpose: Stroke survivors
   and their caregivers (N=275) were surveyed using existing measures to
   explore the prevalence of physical injuries among caregivers and the
   types of injuries and factors associated with caregiver injury. Methods:
   Caregiver measures included items from the National Alliance for
   Caregiving (NAC) survey and the short form of the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Veterans completed items
   on health and functioning from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance
   Survey (BRFSS). Results: We found that stroke caregivers who experience
   high burden levels and/or depression are considerably more likely to
   experience an increased risk for injury. Further, the vast majority of
   injured caregivers indicated that their injury interfered with their
   ability to provide care for the veteran. Conclusion: This suggests that
   injury on the part of the family caregiver may lead to the veteran's
   placement in a skilled nursing facility and lead to increased costs for
   the Department of Veteran's Affairs.},

Abstract = {Dependence of stroke survivors regarding the ability to perform
   activities of daily living imposes a burden on family caregivers. The
   study evaluated the effect of the family-centered empowerment program on
   the ability of Iranian patients with stroke to perform activities of
   daily living, as well as on family caregiver burden. In this randomized
   controlled trial study, a total of 90 pairs of patients with stroke and
   their family caregivers was selected and randomly assigned to the
   intervention or control groups. Patients and their family caregivers
   participated in four family-centered empowerment program sessions over
   four consecutive days while the patient was hospitalized. The difference
   in the ability of patients with stroke in the intervention and control
   groups to perform activities of daily living was not significant 2 weeks
   after the intervention. However, the ability of patients with stroke in
   the intervention group to perform activities of daily living increased
   significantly 2 months after the intervention compared with the control
   group: 66 +/- 35.95 and 51.31 +/- 36.28, respectively (p=0.047). Two
   weeks after the intervention, the family caregiver burden significantly
   decreased in the intervention group (29.55 +/- 15.38) compared with the
   control group (38.77 +/- 18.53 and p=0.012). The burden in the
   intervention group also decreased 2 months after the intervention
   compared with the control group: 22.95 +/- 15.68 and 36.11 +/- 18.88,
   respectively (p<0.001). Nurses can use the family-centered empowerment
   program to improve the quality of life of patients with stroke, and to
   reduce the burden of family caregivers.},

Title = {Caregivers navigating rehabilitative care for people with aphasia after

Abstract = {Background Up to 40\% of stroke survivors acquire aphasia and require
   long-term caregiver assistance after discharge from the hospital.
   Caregivers assume multiple roles as they help people with aphasia to
   access outpatient rehabilitative care in an increasingly person-centred
   model of care. Examining caregiver roles and how different stakeholders
   in the rehabilitative journey perceive these roles may be the first step
   in providing more tailored support to caregivers and improving outcomes
   for both caregivers and people with aphasia. Aims To characterize the
   roles caregivers assume while navigating outpatient rehabilitative care
   for people with aphasia after stroke from the perspective of different
   stakeholders in the rehabilitative process. Methods \& Procedures
   Thirty-six people participated in the study, including seven caregivers,
   22 stroke survivors with aphasia and seven healthcare providers. Focus
   groups were conducted, and an iterative thematic analysis was used to
   identify themes. Outcomes \& Results Results indicate that caregivers
   are perceived differently by varying stakeholders, and that caregivers
   adopt diverse roles as advocates, therapists, motivators and guardians.
   They assume these roles in order to fill gaps in services or otherwise
   to facilitate the recovery journey for the person with aphasia.
   Conclusions \& Implications This study provides a valuable glimpse into
   how varying stakeholders view the role of the caregiver during
   rehabilitation for people with aphasia after stroke. Providing
   caregivers with the training and support they need throughout the
   recovery journey by treating them as partners in the process may
   mitigate the perception of caregivers as feeling compelled to adopt
   multiple roles.},

Abstract = {Introduction The virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic (VMSCC) is
   the first nurse-led clinic developed to offer support to
   community-dwelling stroke survivors and caregivers, and to promote
   poststroke recovery. This two-arm randomised controlled trial will
   evaluate its effectiveness on survivors' self-efficacy (SE), survivors'
   and caregivers' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and
   cost-effectiveness on emergency admissions and length of readmission
   hospital stay.
   Methods and analysis A consecutive sample of 384 stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyads will be recruited from four hospitals. An
   online platform that embraces readily accessible and reliable
   information will be developed.
   Participants randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive
   usual care plus the VMSCC service. The service includes access to a
   tablet containing 30 videos demonstrating appropriate self-care
   strategies, communication with a registered nurse monthly through video
   and telephone calls and regular blood pressure monitoring. Primary
   outcomes include survivors' SE in self-management and survivors' and
   caregivers' HRQoL. Secondary outcomes include survivors' performance of
   self-management behaviours, depression and social participation; and
   caregivers' coping strategies, satisfaction with caring and depression.
   Data will be collected at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after
   commencing the intervention. Survivors' and caregivers' satisfaction
   with the service will be assessed at 6-month follow-up. Multivariable
   regressions and generalised estimating equations model will be
   conducted. Survivors' emergency admissions and length of hospital stay
   will be evaluated during the 6-month follow-up period.
   Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed on the average total cost
   incurred.
   Discussion The results will inform stakeholders about incorporating the
   VMSCC service into current stroke rehabilitation service.
   Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese
   University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research
   Ethics Committee (CREC Ref. No.: 2017.660). All participants will
   provide written informed consent. Results will be disseminated through
   scientific publications, and presentations at local and international
   conferences.

Abstract = {Background: Caregivers are often unprepared and overwhelmed with the
   responsibilities of providing care to stroke survivors, which can lead
   to negative physical and psychological effects. Purpose: To evaluate the
   impact of the Family Informal Caregiver Stroke Self-Management (FICSS)
   program on burden and life changes resulting from providing care among
   family caregivers of stroke survivors. Methods: A prospective pre-test
   and post-test design using quantitative and qualitative data was used to
   evaluate the program with a convenience sample of 42 caregivers. The
   four-module facilitated program consisted of small group-guided
   discussion. Quantitative evaluations were completed at baseline, 2 weeks
   and 6 months (post-intervention), and qualitative data were collected at
   2 weeks and 6 months. Life changes and burden were measured using the
   Bakas Caregiving Outcome Scale (BCOS) and the Oberst Caregiving Burden
   Scale (OCBS), respectively. Results: The BCOS scores increased
   consistently over time, showing significant differences at 6 months
   compared with 2 weeks (mean difference: 5.29, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.30-10.28, p = 0.04) and baseline (mean difference: 7.58, 95\%
   CI: 2.92-12.23, p= 0.001). The OCBS time scores decreased consistently
   over time, showing a significant difference at 6 months compared with
   baseline (mean difference: -5.20, 95\% CI: -0.96 to -9.44, p= 0.02). The
   OCBS difficulty scores fluctuated over time, resulting in no overall
   difference from baseline to 6 months. Qualitative themes were consistent
   with the positive quantitative findings. Conclusion: Study results
   suggest that the FICSS program may result in reduced caregiver burden
   and improved life changes resulting from providing care.},

Title = {Training informal caregivers to care for older people after stroke: A
   quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {74},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2196-2206},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {AimsThis study aimed at evaluating whether training on practical skills
   involved in providing care reduces the burden experienced by informal
   caregivers and improves their general health condition.
   BackgroundA substantial number of informal caregivers lack skills to
   deliver poststroke assistance to older people after hospital discharge,
   which leads to burden situations as well as mental and physical health
   deterioration of the former.
   DesignA quasi-experimental design.
   MethodsThis study involved 174 informal caregivers of older people who
   overcame a stroke. The control group (N=89) received the usual type of
   care delivered in healthcare units. The experimental group (N=85)
   adopted the InCARE programme for 1week (T0), 1month (T1) and 3 (T2)
   months and received telephone support by counselling caregivers on the
   subsequent 3rd, 6th, 8th and 10th weeks to hospital discharge. It aimed
   at facilitating the caregiver's adjustment to the demands of a
   poststroke stage and at increasing knowledge and practical skills to
   support the decision-making. Data collection occurred between
   February-December 2014 at the Community Home Care Services in northern
   Portugal.
   ResultsThe experimental group obtained significantly better results
   regarding practical skills as well as lower burden levels and a better
   general mental health condition when compared with the control group 1
   (T1) and 3 (T2) months after intervention.
   ConclusionFindings suggest that our programme improved practical skills,
   helped reduce burden levels with better scores and improvement regarding
   general mental health condition of informal caregivers.},

Title = {Description of the CARE4STROKE programme: A caregiver-mediated exercises
   intervention with e-health support for stroke patients},
Journal = {PHYSIOTHERAPY RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {BackgroundIntensity of practice and task and context specificity are key
   factors for improving functional outcome in stroke survivors. Novel
   methods are needed to augment intensity of practice with minimal use of
   resources and costs. Caregiver-mediated exercises (CMEs) focused on
   mobility, in which a caregiver acts as an exercise coach and can
   increase the intensity of practice. There is preliminary evidence that
   CME can improve functional outcome, reduce length of stay, and allow
   early supported discharge, without an increase in caregiver burden. In
   the CARE4STROKE programme (C4S), CME therapy and e-health support are
   combined to promote a smoother transition from the inpatient setting to
   the home environment, with active rehabilitation continuing in the
   community. The objective of this paper is to describe the content of the
   C4S intervention in detail and explain implementation of this
   intervention in practice using the Template for Intervention Description
   and Replication checklist.
   MethodsContent, timing and intensity of the programme, participant
   screening and selection, and intervention procedures were described
   using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication
   checklist. Mobility exercises and use of a video application on
   tablet/smartphone are explained. The role of the caregiver as provider
   of the intervention is illustrated.
   DiscussionC4S prescribes an additional exercise dose of 1,200min and may
   be a promising novel and effective method to augment the pallet of
   therapeutic options for stroke rehabilitation. Important aspects for
   successful implementation are availability and suitability of a
   caregiver. Suggestions for additional use of e-health technology are
   described.
   Implications for physiotherapy practiceThe presented description of C4S
   gives physical therapists practical guidelines to facilitate
   implementation of the CME intervention.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveOur aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified 8-week
   reminiscence therapy on the burden, positive experience, and life
   satisfaction of older spouse caregivers and the life satisfaction of
   stroke survivors.
   MethodsWe conducted a randomized controlled trial by using 75 older
   stroke couples recruited from communities in Zhengzhou, China. We
   randomly assigned participants to 1 of 3 groups: Group 1 (G(1), 25
   couples, all attend intervention) and Group 2 (G(2), 22 couples, only
   caregivers attend intervention), who participated in a modified 8-week
   reminiscence therapy, and a waiting list (control) group (G(3), 28
   couples). Interviewers blinded to treatment group assignment
   administered the life satisfaction to both stroke survivors and
   caregivers, caregiver burden, and positive experience for caregivers, at
   preintervention, immediately postintervention, and at 1month and 3months
   after cessation of the intervention.
   ResultsWe found a statistically significant interaction between
   treatment groups and assessment time points for the 4 outcome measures
   (P<.001). Although the effects were decreased after intervention at
   1month, the improvement in caregivers' positive experience, life
   satisfaction, burden, and life satisfaction of stroke survivors were
   still significant (P<.001).
   ConclusionsThe use of a modified 8-week reminiscence therapy in this
   study sample improved the life satisfaction of stroke survivors and
   their spouse caregivers, improved the positive experience of caregivers,
   and decreased the burden of caregivers.},

Title = {Benefit finding for Chinese family caregivers of community-dwelling
   stroke survivors: A cross-sectional study},

Abstract = {Aims and objectives: To identify whether benefit finding is a mediator
   or moderator in the relationship between caregiver burden and
   psychological well-being (anxiety and depression) in Chinese family
   caregivers of community-dwelling stroke survivors.
   Background: Family caregivers not only bear a heavy burden, a high level
   of anxiety and depression, but also experience benefit finding (positive
   effects result from stressful events). However, the relationships among
   benefit finding, caregiver burden and psychological well-being in
   Chinese family caregivers are not well known.
   Design: This study was a cross-sectional correlational design.
   Methods: Caregivers (n=145) of stroke survivors were recruited from two
   communities in Zhengzhou, China. Data were collected by face-to-face
   interviews with structured questionnaires, examining caregiver burden,
   benefit finding and psychological well-being of caregivers. A
   hierarchical regression analysis explored whether caregiver burden and
   benefit finding were associated with anxiety and depression of
   caregivers. The moderator role of benefit finding was examined by
   testing the significance of the interaction between caregiver burden and
   benefit finding. A mediational model was used to test benefit finding as
   a mediator between caregiver burden and psychological well-being of
   caregivers using process in spss 21.0.
   Results: Caregiver burden and benefit finding were significantly
   associated with both anxiety and depression of caregivers. Benefit
   finding did not portray a moderating role, but portrayed the mediator
   role in the relationship between caregiver burden, anxiety and
   depression in caregivers.
   Conclusion: This study provides the preliminary evidence to nurses that
   intervention focus on benefit finding may help improve the psychological
   well-being of caregivers.},

Abstract = {Background: Setting up a follow-up secondary prevention program after
   stroke is difficult due to motor and cognitive impairment, but necessary
   to prevent recurrence and improve patients' quality of life. To involve
   a referent nurse and a caregiver from the patient's social circle in
   nurse-led multimodal and long-term management of risk factors after
   stroke could be an advantage due to their easier access to the patient
   and family. The aim of this study is to compare the benefit of optimized
   follow up by nursing personnel from the vascular neurology department
   including therapeutic follow up, and an interventional program directed
   to the patient and a caregiving member of their social circle, as
   compared with typical follow up in order to develop a specific follow-up
   program of secondary prevention of stroke.
   Methods/design: The design is a randomized, controlled, clinical trial
   conducted in the French Stroke Unit of the Strokavenir network. In
   total, 410 patients will be recruited and randomized in optimized follow
   up or usual follow up for 2 years. In both group, patients will be seen
   by a neurologist at 6, 12 and 24 months. The optimized follow up will
   include follow up by a nurse from the vascular neurology department,
   including therapeutic follow up, and a training program on secondary
   prevention directed to the patient and a caregiving member of their
   social circle. After discharge, a monthly telephone interview, in the
   first year and every 3 months in the second year, will be performed by
   the nurse. At 6, 12 and 24 month, the nurse will give the patient and
   caregiver another training session. Usual follow up is only done by the
   patient's general practitioner, after classical information on secondary
   prevention of risk factors during hospitalization. The primary outcome
   measure is blood pressure measured after the first year of follow up.
   Blood pressure will be measured by nursing personnel who do not know the
   group into which the patient has been randomized. Secondary endpoints
   are associated mortality, morbidity, recurrence, drug side-effects and
   medico-economic analysis.
   Discussion: The result of this trial is expected to provide the benefit
   of a nurse-led optimized multimodal and long-term interventional program
   for management of risk factors after stroke, personalizing the role of
   the nurse and including the patient's caregiver.},

Title = {Stroke Survivor and Caregiver Perspectives on Post-Stroke Visual
   Concerns and Long-Term Consequences},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Approximately 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke
   annually. Up to two thirds of stroke survivors have some visual
   problems, which result in disability and can affect survivors' overall
   rehabilitation outcomes. Although some post-stroke visual impairments
   can be corrected and respond well to intervention, ocular signs can be
   subtle and may not be recognized or reported by the stroke survivor but
   rather by a vigilant caregiver. The purpose of this study was to explore
   the post-stroke visual concerns and consequences expressed by stroke
   survivors and caregivers. This study employed a qualitative design using
   semistructured interviews conducted with a convenience sample of stroke
   survivors and caregivers recruited from either a community support group
   or skilled nursing and long-term care facilities. Interviews were
   recorded and transcribed verbatim. Comparative content analysis was used
   to identify vision-related themes by two independent coders. All
   research team members completed quality checking of coding. Twenty
   participants (11 stroke survivors and 9 caregivers) expressed visual
   concerns or consequences following stroke: (1) eye movement problems,
   (2) perceptual issues, and (3) consequences of vision problems or
   issues, which affected their daily life/quality of life. Stroke
   survivors and caregivers reported receiving vision care from (1) eye
   doctors, (2) occupational therapists, and (3) other healthcare
   professionals. All vision care providers need to be observant of
   potential post-stroke visual concerns. Stroke survivors should have a
   thorough vision evaluation to optimize their independence in everyday
   activities and quality of life.},

Abstract = {Background: Informal care giving can be burdensome particularly where
   the option of institutionalized informal care scarcely exist. Objective:
   To look at the burden of informal caregivers of stroke survivors using
   the Zarit burden interview (ZBI). Method: 64 stroke survivors were
   assessed for demographics of age, gender, duration of follow-up since
   discharged from in-patient care, modified Rankin score at the time of
   discharge and at the time of evaluation for this study and the most
   important informal care giver at home was also assessed for whether care
   giving was telling on their health or life in any negative way. All the
   caregivers were subsequently assessed with the ZBI. Results: Mean age of
   most important informal care givers was 40.67 +/- 14.27 years and the
   sex distribution was 33(51.6\%) female and 29(45.4\%) males. 21(32.8\%)
   reported that caregiving was a health burden. Mean ZBI scores were
   significantly higher (30.19 +/- 14.81 vs 20.30 +/- 12.96, P < 0.01) in
   those that reported that caregiving was telling on their health. ZBI
   overall rating of burden of caregiving was also significantly associated
   with whether caregiving was telling on the health of caregiver (P =
   0.01) and also symmetrically agreed with whether the burden of
   caregiving was telling on health (k = 0.33, P < 0.01). The sensitivity
   and specificity of ZBI were 70\% and 68.4\% respectively on ROC
   statistics (AUC = 0.67, P = 0.017). Conclusion: Reported burden of
   informal caregiving of about 33\% is in our opinion huge. The moderate
   sensitivity and specificity of the ZBI means it could be safely used in
   the population studied.},

Abstract = {Informal caregiving to the elderly is associated with the presence of
   both difficulties and positive rewards, but the latter have been
   considered less systematically in gerontological literature. In this
   cross-sectional study, we compared satisfaction of caregivers of
   demented (n=70) and stroke patients (n=44) by means of the Carer's
   Assessment of Satisfaction Index (CASI) and also compared their
   depression levels. Findings revealed the presence of satisfaction
   deriving from intrapersonal dynamics (elderly as main beneficiary) and
   from interpersonal dynamics (caregiver as main beneficiary) in dementia
   situations, and the presence of satisfaction deriving from intrapersonal
   dynamics (caregiver as main beneficiary) in stroke situations. Both
   subgroups of caregivers revealed similar yet significant levels of
   depression. The need for a better understanding of satisfaction
   experiences in dementia and stroke caregivers is highlighted.},

Abstract = {A strong interpersonal relationship after stroke is important for the
   well-being of survivors and family caregivers. However, as many as 54\%
   of families experience relationship problems after stroke and as many as
   38\% of couples experience overt conflict. The purpose of this study is
   to enhance understanding about relationship challenges among stroke
   dyads and to identify implications for direct practice in social work.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with N = 19 care dyads.
   Qualitative data were analyzed through an interpretive description lens.
   Seven themes about relationship challenges were identified. Findings
   highlight areas to consider in promoting strong relationships between
   survivors and family caregivers. Social workers may have the opportunity
   to assist dyads with disrupting negative communication cycles,
   strengthening empathy and collaboration, and achieving a balance so that
   each person's needs are met.},

Title = {Dyadic approach to post-stroke hospitalizations: role of caregiver and

Journal = {BMC NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},

Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Aim To study the association of caregiver factors and stroke patient
   factors with rehospitalizations over the first 3 months and subsequent
   3-12 months post-stroke in Singapore. Methods Patients with stroke and
   their caregivers were recruited in the Singapore Stroke Study, a
   prospective yearlong cohort. While caregiver and patient variables were
   taken from this study, hospitalization data were extracted from the
   national claims database. We used Poisson modelling to perform bivariate
   and multivariable analysis with counts of hospitalization as the
   outcome. Results Two hundred and fifty-six patient with stroke and
   caregiver dyads (N = 512) were analysed, with patients having spouse
   (60\%), child (29\%), sibling (4\%) and other (7\%) as their caregivers.
   Among all participants, 89\% of index strokes were ischemic, 57\% were
   mild in severity and more than half (59\%) of the patients had moderate
   or severe disability post-stroke as measured on the Modified Rankin
   Scale. Having social support in the form of a foreign domestic worker
   for general help of caregiver reduced the hospitalization rate over 3
   months post-stroke by 66\% (IRR: 0.342; 95\% CI: 0.180, 0.651). Compared
   to having a spousal caregiver, those with a child caregiver had an
   almost three times greater rate of hospitalizations over 3-12 months
   post-stroke (IRR: 2.896; 95\% CI: 1.399, 5.992). Higher reported
   caregiving burden at the 3-month point was associated with the higher
   subsequent rate of hospitalization. Conclusion Recommendations include
   the adoption of a dyadic or holistic approach to post-stroke care
   provision by healthcare practitioners, giving due importance to both
   patients with stroke and their caregivers, integrating caregivers in the
   healthcare system to extend the care continuum to include informal care
   in the community and provision of timely support for caregivers.},

Title = {Acceptability and Attitude towards a Mobile-Based Home Exercise Program
   among Stroke Survivors and Caregivers: A Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Background. Stroke is a leading cause of disability and requires
   continued care after hospital discharge. Mobile-based interventions are
   suitable to reduce the cost of stroke rehabilitation and facilitate
   self-management among stroke survivors. However, before attempting to
   use mobile-based home exercise program, it is crucial to recognize the
   readiness of stroke survivors and their caregivers to opt for such
   interventions. Objective. To assess the acceptability and attitude
   towards a mobile-based home exercise program among stroke survivors and
   their primary caregivers. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted
   among 102 participants to understand their attitude and acceptability
   towards mobile-based home exercise program. A validated 10-item
   questionnaire was adapted for the study. The questions which assessed
   the attitude were rated on a three-point Likert scale, with three
   denoting agree and one denoting disagree. The acceptability was assessed
   by their willingness to opt for a mobile-based home program services. A
   Chi-square analysis and cross-tabulation were performed to test
   differences between caregivers and patients. A logistic regression was
   performed to determine the effects of age, gender, and mobile phone on
   acceptability. Results. Ninety-two percent of caregivers and 90\% of
   patients showed willingness to opt for mobile-based intervention.
   Majority of the participants showed a positive attitude towards this
   mode of treatment. There was no difference in the attitude noted among
   caregivers and patients (p>0.05) towards mobile-based intervention.
   Conclusion. The stroke survivors and caregivers welcomed the concept of
   mobile-based home exercise program even in a low-resource settings, but
   further studies to understand treatment and cost-effectiveness of this
   technology among the stroke survivors would lead to better
   implementation.},

Title = {Effect of Telenursing on Levels of Depression and Anxiety in Caregivers
   of Patients with Stroke: A Randomized Clinical Trial},

Abstract = {Background: Telenursing is a low-cost, highly accessible method that can
   lead to increased awareness on the principles of care, and may
   eventually help reduce the stress experienced by caregivers of patients
   with stroke. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of
   telenursing through phone consultation on the levels of depression and
   anxiety in family caregivers of patients with stroke. Materials and
   Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial including 152 caregivers
   of stroke patients discharged from Mohammad Vase'ee Hospital in Sabzevar
   in 2016. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling method
   and were randomly assigned to control (n = 76) and intervention (n = 76)
   groups. The intervention consisted of 32 sessions of phone consultation.
   Research tools included demographic characteristics form, needs
   assessment questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety
   Inventory. Data were analyzed with independent t test using SPSS,
   version 23. Results: Mean (SD) post-intervention anxiety scores for the
   intervention and the control group were statistically significant (t =
   3.51, p = 0.001). However, the difference in mean depression scores
   after intervention was not significant (p = 0.70). Conclusions:
   Telenursing can be employed to facilitate the care of chronic patients
   as well as increase the psychological well-being of the caregivers
   through providing practical and specialized information.},

Abstract = {Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of our 4-week
   caregiver-mediated exercise (CME) in improving trunk control capacity,
   gait, and balance and in decreasing concerns about post-stroke falls
   when there is an increase in its efficacy.
   Methods Acute or subacute stroke survivors were assigned to either the
   trial group (n=35) or the control group (n=37). Changes in Modified
   Barthel Index (MBI), Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC), Berg
   Balance Scale (BBS), and Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) scores at 4 weeks
   from baseline served as primary outcome measures. Correlations of
   primary outcome measures with changes in Fall Efficacy
   Scale-International (FES-I) scores at 4 weeks from baseline in the trial
   group served as secondary outcome measures. Treatment-emergent adverse
   events (TEAEs) served as safety outcome measures.
   Results There were significant differences in changes in MBI, FAC, BBS,
   TIS-T, TIS-D, TIS-C, and FES-I scores at 4 weeks from baseline between
   the two groups (all p<0.0001). There were no significant (p=0.0755)
   differences in changes in TIS-S scores at 4 weeks from baseline between
   the two groups. MBI, FAC, BBS, and TIS scores showed significantly
   inverse correlations with FES-I scores in patients receiving CME. There
   were no TEAEs in our series.
   Conclusion CME was effective and safe in improving the degree of
   independence, ambulation status, dynamic and static balance, trunk
   function, and concerns about post-stroke falls in stroke survivors.},

Title = {`I felt pain. Deep pain ... `: Experiences of primary caregivers of
   stroke survivors with aphasia in a South African township},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF DISABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: Aphasia is an acquired impairment in language and in the
   cognitive processes that underlie language. Aphasia affects the quality
   of life of the person with aphasia (PWA) and his or her families in
   various ways in diverse contexts and cultures. It is therefore important
   that speech language therapists understand how different contextual and
   cultural factors may mediate experiences.
   Purpose: The aim of the study was to describe the caregiving experience
   of female caregivers of PWA residing in Tembisa, a township situated in
   the east of Johannesburg.
   Method: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   primary caregivers of PWA. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 14
   primary caregivers of PWA who were daughters, daughters-in-law or wives
   of the PWA. The interviews were conducted in participants' first
   language and analysed by the researcher, who is proficient in isiZulu.
   Data were analysed according to the principles of thematic analysis.
   Results: Findings indicated that caregivers are unfamiliar with aphasia
   and the support available to them. Participants experienced frustration
   and found communication to be challenging owing to their lack of
   communication strategies. The participants' experiences reflected their
   context-specific experiences, such as feminisation of caregiving,
   barriers to healthcare, the influence of low health literacy and
   contextual perspectives on stroke and aphasia.
   Conclusions: Contextual factors of caregivers in Tembisa have an
   influence on the experiences between caregivers and PWA, the feelings of
   individuals and families and health-seeking behaviours of individuals
   and families.},

Abstract = {Incorporating user requirements in the design of e-rehabilitation
   interventions facilitates their implementation. However, insight into
   requirements for e-rehabilitation after stroke is lacking. This study
   investigated which user requirements for stroke e-rehabilitation are
   important to stroke patients, informal caregivers, and health
   professionals. The methodology consisted of a survey study amongst
   stroke patients, informal caregivers, and health professionals
   (physicians, physical therapists and occupational therapists). The
   survey consisted of statements about requirements regarding
   accessibility, usability and content of a comprehensive stroke e-health
   intervention (4-point Likert scale, 1=unimportant/4=important). The mean
   with standard deviation was the metric used to determine the importance
   of requirements. Patients (N=125), informal caregivers (N=43), and
   health professionals (N=105) completed the survey. The mean score of
   user requirements regarding accessibility, usability and content for
   stroke e-rehabilitation was 3.1 for patients, 3.4 for informal
   caregivers and 3.4 for health professionals. Data showed that a large
   number of user requirements are important and should be incorporated
   into the design of stroke e-rehabilitation to facilitate their
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Objectives The needs and rights awareness of stroke survivors have not
   been reported in China. This study investigated the needs and rights
   awareness of stroke survivors and caregivers in Tianjin, China.
   Setting A survey launched by the World Stroke Organization was conducted
   in Tianjin, China. The questionnaire included demands for psychological
   support, treatment and care, social support and information. Stroke
   survivors and their caregivers were interviewed face to face for the
   questionnaire. Between June 2014 and February 2015, stroke survivors
   were invited to participate if they were more than 18 years old and had
   experienced a stroke. Exclusion criteria were patients who had disorders
   of consciousness, significant cognitive impairment, aphasia,
   communication difficulties or psychiatric disorders. Only caregivers who
   were family members of the patients were chosen. Paid caregivers were
   excluded.
   Participants Two hundred and forty-eight stroke survivors and 212
   caregivers were enrolled.
   Primary outcome measures The correlations between levels of needs and
   potential effect factors were analysed. Levels of different needs were
   compared by age, gender and time since stroke. 555Results Among the
   cohort, 95.6\% stroke survivors and 92.5\% caregivers agreed to each
   question in the questionnaire. The participants prioritised the needs
   for psychological support (99.4\%), treatment and care (98.6\%), social
   support (98\%) and information (96.2\%). The total score was negatively
   correlated with age (r=-0.255, p<0.01). Patients below 65 years old had
   higher scores than those 65 years or older (p<0.01), while male patients
   had higher scores than female patients (p<0.01).
   Conclusions The needs for psychological and emotional support,
   individual treatment, social support and information about stroke were
   eagerly reported by most survivors. The Bill of Rights must be
   recognised by the Chinese society, providing appropriate stroke care to
   every patient to optimise stroke outcomes.},

Abstract = {Objective: Depressive symptoms are a common problem among family
   caregivers of stroke survivors. The purpose of this study was to examine
   the association between care recipient's impairment and caregiver
   depression, and determine the possible mediating effects of caregiver
   negative problem-orientation, mastery, and leisure time satisfaction.
   The evaluated model was derived from Pearlin's stress process model of
   caregiver adjustment. Method: We analyzed baseline data from 122
   strained family members who were assisting stroke survivors in Germany
   for a minimum of 6 months and who consented to participate in a
   randomized clinical trial. Depressive symptoms were measured with the
   Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The cross-sectional
   data were analyzed using path analysis. Results: The results show an
   adequate fit of the model to the data, chi(2)( 1, N = 122) = 0.17, p =
   .68; comparative fit index = 1.00; root mean square error of
   approximation: p = .01; standardized root mean square residual = 0.01.
   The model explained 49\% of the variance in the caregiver depressive
   symptoms. Results indicate that caregivers at risk for depression
   reported a negative problem orientation, low caregiving mastery, and low
   leisure time satisfaction. The situation is particularly affected by the
   frequency of stroke survivor problematic behavior, and by the degree of
   their impairments in activities of daily living. Conclusion: The
   findings provide empirical support for the Pearlin's stress model and
   emphasize how important it is to target these mediators in health
   promotion interventions for family caregivers of stroke survivors.},

Abstract = {Objective: To compare treatment fidelity among treatment arms in the
   Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit study for stroke caregivers
   (TASK II) with respect to: 1) protocol adherence; 2) intervention dosage
   and 3) nurse intervener perspectives.
   Design: A randomized controlled clinical trial design.
   Setting: Urban, community, midwestern United States.
   Subjects: A total of 254 stroke caregivers (mean +/- SD age, 54.4 +/-
   11.8 years), 55 (22.0\%) males and 199 (78.4\%) females) randomized to
   the TASK II intervention (n=123) or an Information, Support, and
   Referral comparison group (n=131).
   Interventions: TASK II participants received the TASK II Resource Guide;
   Information, Support, and Referral participants received a standard
   caregiver brochure. At approximately 8 weeks after discharge, both
   groups received 8 weekly calls from a nurse, with a booster call 4 weeks
   later.
   Measures: Protocol adherence was evaluated with the TASK II Checklist
   for Monitoring Adherence. Intervention dosage was measured by the number
   of minutes caregivers spent reading materials and talking with the
   nurse. Nurse intervener perspectives were obtained through focus groups.
   Results: Protocol adherence was 80\% for the TASK II and 92\% for the
   Information, Support, and Referral. As expected, intervention dosage
   differed between TASK II and Information, Support, and Referral with
   respect to caregiver time spent reading materials (t=-6.49; P<.001) and
   talking with the nurse (t=-7.38; P<.001). Focus groups with nurses
   yielded further evidence for treatment fidelity and recommendations for
   future trials.
   Conclusions: These findings substantiate treatment fidelity in both
   study arms of the TASK II stroke caregiver intervention trial (NIH
   R01NR010388; ClinicalTrials.govNCT01275495).},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore stroke survivors', caregivers', and health care
   professionals' perceptions of weekend passes offered during inpatient
   rehabilitation and its role in facilitating the transition home.
   Design: Qualitative descriptive.
   Subjects: Sixteen stroke survivors, 15 caregivers, and 20 health care
   professionals' from a rehabilitation hospital.
   Methods: Participants discussed their perceptions of the purpose of the
   weekend pass, experiences with the weekend pass including supports
   needed, and weekend pass administration. Focus group and interview data
   were audio recorded, professionally transcribed, checked for accuracy,
   and analyzed using conventional content analysis.
   Results: We identified 3 key themes: i) preparing for patients to be
   safe at home; gaining insight through the weekend pass; and the
   emotional context of the weekend pass. These themes varied by
   participant group.
   Conclusions: When offering weekend passes, stroke care systems should
   carefully consider patients' and caregivers' readiness, emotional state,
   and preparation for weekend passes. The weekend pass experience can
   inform in-patient therapy, provide patients and caregivers with insight
   into life after stroke, and help prepare patients and families for the
   ultimate transition home.},

Abstract = {The main objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of
   the nursing diagnosis caregiver role strain (CRS) in caregivers of
   patients with stroke and to identify the accuracy of this diagnosis's
   clinical indicators. A total of 42 stroke patient caregivers who
   provided in-home care services in a city in north-eastern Brazil. The
   sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of clinical indicators of
   nursing diagnosis `CRS' were analyzed. Study participants were mostly
   female, married and the daughters of stroke patients. CRS was present in
   73.8\% of caregivers. The presence of the clinical indicators,
   specifically, lack of time to meet personal needs (p = 0.011), increased
   emotional lability (p = 0.001), withdrawal from social life (p = 0.002),
   and changes in leisure activities (p = 0.002), presented high values for

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to describe the sociodemographic
   characteristics and the quality of life of the caregivers of elderly
   individuals with a stroke history, and correlate morbidity with the
   caregivers' quality of life scores. This is a cross-sectional household
   survey that interviewed the caregivers of elderly individuals using the
   following tools: a semi-structured instrument; the World Health
   Organization Quality of life-BREF; and the Brazilian Multidimensional
   Functional Assessment Questionnaire. Descriptive analysis and Pearson's
   correlation (p<0.05) were performed. Most participants were female
   (93.5\%), with a mean age of 55.4 +/- 14.17 years, married or living
   with a partner (58.7\%), with four to eight years of education (28.3\%),
   and an income equivalent to one minimum wage salary (34.8\%). The
   highest quality of life score was in the social relations domain (67.57)
   and the lowest was in the environmental domain (54.82). The highest
   number of caregiver morbidities correlated with the lowest scores in all
   quality of life domains.},

   stroke, in their home. It was held in the Program of Domiciliary
   Assistance of a tertiary public hospital in Fortaleza-CE, with nine
   caregivers. The statements were obtained through interviews recorded and
   organized into categories, then interpreted according to the Symbolic
   Interactionism method: why I take care?, Realizing the family victimized
   by stroke, the daily activities of caregivers, perceiving themselves as
   caregivers and the changes in the lives of caregivers. The analysis
   suggests that the nurse insert into its care tools that facilitate the
   process of adaptation to the new situation of the family, such as
   sensitivity to promote the training of familiar caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose: A Web-based education/support intervention for caregivers of
   stroke survivors was developed. A prospective, descriptive design was
   used to identify caregivers' reported reasons for stroke survivors'
   health care service use (i.e., health care provider and emergency
   department visits, hospital readmissions) during the first year after
   initial treatment. Method: Caregivers were recruited in the Midwest and
   randomized into an experimental (Web users, n=36) or control (non-Web
   users, n=37) group. Telephone interviews were conducted with the
   caregivers every 2 weeks. Reported reasons were organized by group and
   time period in which the service occurred (i.e., Months 1-6 or 7-12;
   1-year totals). Content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to
   analyze these data. Results: Two themes emerged: wellness- and
   problem-oriented reasons for health care service use. Web users reported
   a large percentage of visits for rehabilitations reasons, which may have
   subsequently contributed to the musculoskeletal issues of this group.
   Laboratory work and testing was considered by both groups as a primary
   reason for provider visits. Non-Web users reported that medication
   adjustment was a common reason for provider visits. They also had more
   emergency department visits and hospital admissions for cardiology or
   pulmonology reasons. Conclusion: This study informs professionals about
   the care and needs of stroke survivors and provides direction for
   education and supportive interactions with caregivers and survivors.},

   experienced an acute stroke recover more slowly than Caucasians in the
   United States. This descriptive study examines (1) the variation in
   Caucasian, Puerto Rican, and African American motor function after
   stroke; (2) the association between caregiver attributes and motor
   recovery after stroke; and (3) the degree to which caregiver attributes
   explain the variation in motor recovery between different racial/ethnic
   groups. One hundred and thirty-five veterans who had been hospitalized
   after an acute stroke, released home, and identified an informal
   caregiver were enrolled in the study. Veterans and caregivers were
   surveyed at five time points over the course of 24 months. Results
   indicate that Puerto Ricans show greater impairment and African
   Americans show less impairment at discharge from the hospital compared
   with Caucasians. Caregiver characteristics mediate the racial/ethnic
   differences in impairment at discharge and motor recovery across time.},

Abstract = {This study identified problems and associated feelings experienced by
   family caregivers of stroke survivors during the second and third month
   after discharge from a rehabilitation facility to home. Safety was the
   most frequent problem identified by family caregivers. Other problems
   were managing activities of daily living (ADLs) and cognitive,
   behavioral, and emotional changes by stroke survivors. About half of
   caregivers; expressed more positive feelings toward managing these
   problems by week 8 and the majority expressed these feelings by week 12.},

   caregivers of stroke survivors in Saudi Arabia. The respondents were
   frequently using religious coping strategies than existential coping
   strategies. The respondents received higher support from significant
   others and lowest support from friends. The majority of the respondents
   had mild to moderate depression, while more than one-third had mild to
   severe anxiety. Psychological health received the highest QOL, while
   physical health received the poorest QOL. Spiritual coping and social
   support significantly influenced the informal caregivers' mental health

Title = {Investigating the needs of family caregivers of older stroke patients: a
   longitudinal study in Iran},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},

Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Background The high burden of care associated with older stroke patients
   is a factor that threatens the health of family caregivers. Identifying
   the needs of family caregivers in this group of patients can help
   provide effective solutions. The present study aimed to determine the
   needs of family caregivers of older stroke patients. Methods The sample
   size of this longitudinal study included 200 family caregivers of older
   stroke patients from two hospitals in Iran. Data collection included
   demographics, responses to family caregivers' needs questionnaires, and
   the Barthel Index which was taken in four stages including admission
   time, pre-discharge, two weeks and 12 weeks post-discharge. Results The
   results showed that all participants at all stages of the study
   identified ``respect for the patient when providing education,
   treatment, or rehabilitation{''} as one of their needs. There was a
   statistically significant relationship between the older adult
   survivor's age and the number of family caregivers' needs two weeks
   post-discharge (p = 0.012) and 12 weeks post-discharge (p = 0.008).
   There was a significant relationship between the patient's
   hospitalization period and the number of caregivers' needs three months
   after the patient's discharge (p = 0.028), and a significant statistical
   relationship between the pre-discharge physiotherapy of the patients and
   the number of their caregivers' needs during the two weeks
   post-discharge (p = 0.018). There was also a statistically significant
   relationship between the patient's level of dependence and the number of
   caregivers' needs (p = 0.0001). On the contrary, there was no
   significant relationship between the sex, place of living, and
   underlying disease history of the patient and the number of caregivers'
   needs (p > 0.05). Conclusion The results of the present research
   indicate that the total number of caregivers' needs decreases with
   increasing duration of the disease. However, respite and care provision
   planning by other family members, seeking assistance from professional
   caregivers, and the search for community support resources can help
   reduce the burden of care of caregivers and give them the opportunity to
   meet their needs in different dimensions of patient care provided.},

Abstract = {Family caregivers play an important role in the rehabilitation of stroke
   survivors. The aims of this study were to describe preparedness,
   uncertainty, and knowledge regarding stroke in family caregivers of
   people who have undergone strokes and to investigate factors influencing
   preparedness. A total of 306 caregivers completed the questionnaires,
   including the Caregiver Preparedness Scale, the Mishel Uncertainty in
   Illness Scale, and Knowledge of Stroke. The result showed that the mean
   score of the family caregivers' preparedness was 14.42, the mean score
   of disease uncertainty was 75.62, and the mean score of stroke knowledge
   was 10.41. Caregiver preparedness was negatively correlated with disease
   uncertainty and positively correlated with knowledge. Multivariate
   stepwise regression analysis showed that educational background,
   profession, caregiving experience and uncertainty degree of the family
   caregivers, gender, and age of stroke survivor could predict 45.90\% of
   the total variation in preparedness. The findings suggest that
   demographic characteristics of stroke survivor and family caregiver, as
   well as caregivers' disease uncertainty, enable predict the level of
   caregiver preparedness. Medical professionals should pay attention to
   providing personalized and targeted approaches to maximize caregivers'
   preparedness.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To explore perceptions of people with neurological conditions
   and their caregivers of the health benefits of a group, task-oriented
   community-based exercise programme incorporating a healthcare-recreation
   partnership. Materials and methods: Descriptive qualitative study.
   Individuals with balance and mobility deficits from a neurological
   condition, and their caregivers, were interviewed on completion of a
   group, task-oriented community-based exercise programme incorporating a
   healthcare-recreation partnership. A thematic analysis was performed.
   Results: Nine people post-stroke, and four people with multiple
   sclerosis (MS) (n = 13; 54\% male) and 12 caregivers (83\% spouses)
   participated. Two themes emerged. One theme indicated that the programme
   fosters diverse, interrelated health benefits. Participants described
   experiences of improved balance, strength, and confidence that
   translated to improved everyday functioning and social participation.
   Benefits were reinforced through repeated programme registration. A
   second theme indicated that caregivers experience challenges and diverse
   benefits related to the programme. Transportation and programme cost
   were primary challenges. Caregivers described emotional health benefits
   from assisting participants during classes and observing participants
   improvement over time. Conclusions: Group, task-oriented community-based
   exercise programmes incorporating a healthcare-recreation partnership
   may yield health benefits for exercise participants and caregivers.
   Results can guide programme evaluation, the nature and timing of
   education about such programmes, and efforts to address cost and
   transportation issues.Implications of rehabilitation Stroke and multiple
   sclerosis commonly cause balance and mobility limitations that can
   result in physical inactivity and further deterioration in health.
   Group, task-oriented community-based exercise programmes in which
   rehabilitation professionals train and support fitness instructors to
   deliver the exercise programme in community centres may increase access
   to exercise participation for this group. Study results suggest by
   improving balance and mobility, these programmes help increase
   independence in activities of daily living and social and leisure
   participation, while improving caregiver mental health and decreasing
   the need for caregiver assistance. Rehabilitation professionals can use
   findings to inform patient education, and support programme
   implementation and referral.},

Title = {Association between incongruence about survivor function and outcomes
   among stroke survivors and family caregivers},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors and family caregivers often have
   incongruent appraisals of survivor cognitive, physical, and psychosocial
   function. Partner incongruence contributes to poor outcomes for
   survivors and caregivers. Objectives: This study explored whether
   partner incongruence: (1) differs by function domain; (2) increases or
   decreases over time, and; (3) is associated with self-rated health,
   distress, stress, and depressive symptoms. Methods: Structured surveys
   were administered to 32 survivors and caregivers at approximately 3
   (enrollment) and 7 months (follow-up) post-stroke. Paired t-tests were
   used to examine partners' ratings of survivor function at enrollment and
   follow-up, and changes in incongruence over time. Partial correlations
   were used to examine the association between incongruence at enrollment
   and outcomes at follow-up. Results: Survivors consistently rated their
   own memory and thinking as significantly better than caregivers rated
   their memory and thinking. At follow-up, survivors rated their own
   communication as significantly better than caregivers rated their
   communication. Incongruence about survivor memory and thinking was
   associated with survivor distress, as well as caregiver distress,
   stress, and depressive symptoms. Incongruence about survivor ADLs was
   associated with caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. Incongruence
   about survivor social participation was associated with caregiver
   distress. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that survivors
   and caregivers often have incongruent appraisals of survivor function,
   that incongruence does not improve naturally over time, and that
   incongruence may be detrimental for survivor and caregiver outcomes.
   Further research should be directed at the mitigation of incongruence
   and strategies to improve outcomes for both survivors and family
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine factors influencing
   the health status of caregivers of stroke survivors. A total of 126
   caregivers of stroke survivors were recruited from three outpatient
   clinics in Thai Nguyen National General Hospital, Vietnam, from November
   2016 to March 2017. Data were collected through six instruments: a
   demographic questionnaire, the Modified Barthel Index, the Zarit Burden
   Interview Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support,
   the Family Caregiver Conflict Scale, and the Short Form-36 Health
   Survey. Stepwise multiple regression was employed to analyze the data.
   Caregiver burden, patient's functional status, caregiver's age, and
   social support together explained 80.3\% of the variations in health
   status of caregivers of stroke survivors. Caregiver burden was the
   strongest predictor of health status of these caregivers. Based on the
   findings, nurses should take caregiver's age, functional status of
   stroke survivors, caregiver burden, and social support into
   consideration when preparing family caregivers to provide care for
   stroke survivors. To reduce perceived caregiver burden, family support
   interventions should be embraced to enhance health status of the
   caregivers of stroke survivors.},

Abstract = {Aim This study aimed to investigate the effect of progressive muscle
   relaxation on the caregiver burden and level of depression among the
   caregivers of older patients with a stroke. Methods This randomized,
   controlled experimental study was conducted between December, 2015 and
   July, 2017 with the caregivers of older patients with a stroke who had
   been admitted to the home care unit of a state hospital. The caregivers
   were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 23) and control (n = 21)
   groups, based on the study's inclusion criteria. The caregivers in the
   intervention group practiced progressive muscle relaxation exercises at
   home 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The control group had no intervention.
   Results The mean age of the older patients with a stroke was 80.15 +/-
   9.86 years and the mean duration of the disease was 39.07 +/- 44.69
   months. The mean age of the caregivers was 50.29 +/- 12.62 years, 84.1\%
   of whom were female, 38.6\% were elementary school graduates, and 86.4\%
   were married. It was found that there was a statistically significant
   decrease in the mean Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale and Beck Depression
   Scale scores of the caregivers in the intervention group after
   practicing progressive muscle relaxation, but this decrease was not
   statistically significant when the intervention and control groups were
   compared. Conclusion This study showed that there was a statistically
   significant decrease in the caregiver burden and level of depression
   among the caregivers in the intervention group after progressive muscle
   relaxation exercises, but that there was no statistically significant
   difference when the intervention and control groups were compared.},

Abstract = {Globally, stroke is the leading cause of death and disease burden. While
   post-stroke studies have been conducted, they excluded survivors and
   caregivers from underserved communities. It can be argued that the
   impact of stroke on survivors and caregivers from underserved
   communities may be greater. Using qualitative exploratory research
   design, the purpose of this study was to examine the lived experiences
   of post-stroke recovery and readjustment among stroke survivors and
   stroke caregivers from an underserved community. Two separate focus
   groups were conducted, one each for stroke survivors and caregivers.
   Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Finding meaning in life
   is the general theme of stroke survivors' and stroke caregivers' journey
   of post-stroke recovery and readjustment. For stroke survivors, the
   transition to stroke recovery required time, life goal reconfiguration,
   willpower, humor, and network support. Post-stroke caregiving is a daily
   navigation and negotiation influenced by internal and external
   processes. Personal, economic, and socio-cultural nuances play a role in
   how post-stroke recovery is lived and experienced. Study findings
   highlight the importance of policies to support family-centered and
   system-level advocacy in post-stroke care.},

Abstract = {Background: Family members provide valuable contributions during
   rehabilitation after stroke, but frequently report higher incidences of
   burden, depression, and social isolation during caregiving. Thus,
   effective interventions to reduce stroke impact on the family are
   needed.
   Objectives: To evaluate the content validity and satisfaction of a
   caregiver-focused web-based intervention designed to improve stroke
   survivor physical function while reducing caregiver negative outcomes.
   Methods: Caregivers of individuals with stroke (N = 6) and expert
   rehabilitation researchers (N = 4) were presented with a novel,
   web-based intervention (CARE-CITE) designed to foster problem-solving
   and skill-building while facilitating caregiver involvement during
   constraint-induced movement therapy. Caregivers rated CARE-CITE for
   usefulness, ease of use, acceptability, and time to complete.
   Rehabilitation experts evaluated content for accuracy, feasibility,
   acceptability, problem relevance and ease of use. Ratings were assessed
   using a five-point Likert-type response scales (1 = strongly disagree to
   5 = strongly agree).
   Results: On average, all caregivers agreed or strongly agreed that the
   modules were useful (4.42), easy to use (4.60), and acceptable (4.41).
   Mean total satisfaction score was 4.45, and average review time was 15
   min per module. Expert reviewers agreed or strongly agreed that each
   module was accurate (4.95), feasible (4.8), easy to use (4.86),
   acceptable (4.96), and had appropriate problem relevance (4.65).
   Conclusions: The CARE-CITE intervention may be a viable program for
   caregivers of patients with stroke. Currently a pilot study is underway
   to evaluate the impact of the intervention on caregiver mental health,
   family conflict around stroke recovery and stroke survivor upper
   extremity function.},

Abstract = {Caregivers' stress following a family member's stroke is likely
   accentuated by its associated uncertainty. The purpose of the current
   study was to examine the effect of uncertainty on caregivers' perceived
   and physiological stress (i.e., salivary cortisol). A prospective,
   longitudinal observational study was conducted with a convenience sample
   of 40 caregivers and stroke survivors recruited from acute care
   settings. Linear mixed models were used. Greater uncertainty was
   associated with higher perceived stress (p < 0.001), but not with
   physiological stress (p = 0.32 on waking, p = 0.06 evening), over the
   first 6 weeks post-stroke. A significant association between uncertainty
   and evening salivary cortisol level was found at 6 weeks post-stroke (p
   = 0.009). Recognition of uncertainty early in the caregiving period and
   targeted interventions may be useful in reducing perceived stress for
   this group.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors are discharged home before they are
   functionally independent and return home with activity limitations that
   would not be manageable without a caregiver.
   Aim: To determine stroke survivors' levels of community reintegration,
   quality of life (QOL), satisfaction with the physiotherapy services and
   the level of caregiver strain at community health centres within the
   Johannesburg area.
   Method: This was a cross-sectional study using the following outcome
   measures: Maleka Stroke Community Reintegration Measure, Stroke-specific
   quality of life scale, Caregiver strain index and Physical therapy
   patient satisfaction questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 108 stroke survivors and 45 caregivers participated
   in this study. The average age of the stroke survivors was 54 years
   (standard deviation = 12.73) and 58\% (n = 62) had moderate to full
   community reintegration. They were happy with physiotherapy services but
   not with parking availability and cost of services. The QOL was poor
   with the lowest scores for energy and highest scores for vision and
   language domains. Twenty five (55\%) caregivers were strained. A
   positive correlation was found between community reintegration and
   satisfaction with services (r = 0.27, p < 0.0001) and QOL (r = 0.51, p <
   0.0001). A negative correlation was found between community
   reintegration and caregiver strain (r = -0.37, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Most stroke survivors are reintegrated into their
   communities except in the areas of work and education and have poor QOL
   and most of their caregivers are strained; however, they are satisfied
   with physiotherapy services.},

Abstract = {Caregiver burden is a main outcome domain in caregiver intervention
   research. A recommended instrument for measuring burden is the Sense of
   Competence Questionnaire (SCQ). In this study, we evaluated the
   psychometric properties of the German version of the SCQ with informal
   caregivers of stroke patients. Baseline data of a randomized controlled
   trial (n = 122) and survey data (n = 76) of caregivers of stroke
   patients were used. Data were collected at the caregiver's or the care
   receiver's home or over the telephone. We evaluated the homogeneity, the
   construct validity, and the clinical validity of the German version and
   the homogeneity of a new abbreviated version. The homogeneity of the SCQ
   indicates good reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.89). The three-factor
   structure of the SCQ was mostly confirmed through principal components
   analyses using oblimin rotation. Clinical validity was supported through
   correlations between sense of competence and burden (r = -0.51),
   depression (r = -0.52), and care recipient's cognitive function (r =
   0.36). Sixteen items with consistent factor loadings were extracted and
   proposed as a new abbreviated version of the SCQ (Cronbach's alpha:
   0.84). The abbreviated German rendition of the SCQ version that was
   validated in this study offers a consistent version that can be applied
   across different languages and among caregivers of stroke survivors or
   people with dementia.},

Abstract = {This mixed-methods study explored the use of the Supportive Care Needs
   Framework (M. Fitch, 1998; M. Fitch, H. B. Porter, \& B. D. Page, 2008)
   as an overall guide to identify the wide spectrum of needs of the family
   caregivers of patients with stroke. Within this framework, a needs
   assessment survey developed for a different complex medical population
   was modified and administered to 10 caregivers of patients recently
   diagnosed with stroke to identify the specific needs of this population.
   The applicability of the tool was further evaluated through a focus
   group of nurses working in acute stroke care. The Supportive Care Needs
   Framework provides a useful and comprehensive framework for the
   assessment of caregiver need. Results suggest that although additional
   validation is needed, the modified survey may aid nurses in early
   identification of caregiver needs.},

Title = {Gender- and age-specific aspects of assistance need in caregivers of
   stroke patients: Results from a qualitative panel study},
Journal = {REHABILITATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {145-149},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim: The present study aimed at investigating the need for professional
   assistance in carers of stroke patients who do not require a therapeutic
   group intervention; and furthermore, how this need for assistance is
   changing in the course of rehabilitation.
   Method: Ten highly burdened spouses of stroke survivors were interviewed
   twice in the framework of a qualitative panel study. In-depth interviews
   concerning subjective burden and assistance requirements were carried
   out and analyzed using Grounded Theory coding procedures.
   Results: The evaluation of the interview data showed that the relatives'
   needs for assistance change in the course of rehabilitation, and feature
   gender- and age-specific differences. Assistance needs persist in the
   medium and long term, with qualitative diversifications: During the
   in-patient rehabilitation period, carers request mainly illness-related
   information, whereas emotional assistance is rarely desired. This is
   different during the out-patient rehabilitation period: While the desire
   for further information decreases, the need for emotional assistance (e.
   g. disburdening counselling) increasingly comes to the fore. Women much
   more often desire professional assistance than men.
   Discussion: When designing and offering professional assistance for
   caregivers of stroke patients, gender- and age-specific aspects should
   be taken into account, as well as the medium-and long-term changes in
   assistance need.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine congruence of depressive symptom appraisal
   between persons with stroke and their caregivers and the influence of
   caregiver and clinical characteristics of stroke recovery on the
   congruence of symptom appraisal. Design: Cross-sectional using baseline
   data from a multisite caregiving study. Participants: 130
   caregiver-person with stroke dyads. Main Outcome Measures: Five items
   from the Stroke Impact Mood subscale (alpha = .72) and 6 items from
   caregivers' appraisals of depressive symptoms of persons with stroke on
   the Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (alpha = .61) were used to
   compare caregiver and person with stroke depressive symptom appraisal.
   Results: Most dyads were incongruent in their appraisals of depressive
   symptoms in the person with stroke. Dyads were congruent primarily when
   they perceived that the person with stroke had an absence of depressive
   symptoms. Caregiver gender, caregiver depressive symptoms, person with
   stroke antidepressant use, and time since stroke were important factors
   influencing congruence. Conclusion: Specific information regarding
   depressive symptoms after stroke should be targeted to both persons with
   stroke and their family caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose To describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of
   caregivers and survivors of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and stroke
   during one year post discharge in comparison to age- and sex-matched
   population norms; and to analyse the association of initial stroke
   severity, measured by a routinely used stroke-specific scale, on
   subsequent HRQoL of caregivers and survivors. Methods Cohort of
   hospitalized patients with TIA and stroke discharged alive from a large
   university hospital in Norway, and their informal caregivers.
   Questionnaires at 3 and 12 months post discharge were filled out by
   caregivers (n = 320 and n = 326, respectively) and survivors (n = 368
   and n = 383, respectively). Multivariable linear regression analyses
   tested associations between initial stroke severity (National Institutes
   of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) in caregivers and
   survivors. Results Caregivers of survivors with TIA or stroke did not
   report lower HRQoL than matched norms. There was some evidence of an
   association of the NIHSS with caregiver HRQoL at 3 months only
   (age-sex-adjusted coefficient - 0.01, p = 0.008), however, this was
   attenuated after additional adjustments. Survivors with stroke, but not
   TIA, reported lower HRQoL than population norms at both time points.
   There was a negative association between higher NIHSS scores and
   survivors' HRQoL; fully adjusted coefficient - 0.01 at both time points
   (p = 0.001). Conclusion The informal caregivers and survivors with TIA
   did not report lower than expected HRQoL. Increasing stroke severity was
   associated with decreasing HRQoL among survivors, but had limited
   predictive value among caregivers. Other factors may therefore be better
   indicators of `at risk' caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Caregiver-mediated exercises are a novel way of delivering
   augmented exercise therapy for patients with stroke, in which patients
   do additional therapeutic exercises together with a caregiver. This
   explorative qualitative study is part of the CARE4STROKE trial and
   focused on how participants manage these exercises together. The
   research questions were: (1) how do the patient-caregiver couples
   exercise together? and (2) what does exercising together bring about,
   besides more hours of practice? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with patients and caregivers who participated in the
   CARE4STROKE intervention. Inductive thematic data analysis was applied.
   Results: Seven patients and seven caregivers were interviewed. Three
   different role-dynamics were found during caregiver-mediated exercises:
   (1) patient in control, (2) in concert, and (3) the caregiver as
   informal carer. In addition, three themes were identified about what
   exercising together brings about: (a) tailor-made exercises through
   active involvement, (b) preparation for the home situation, and (c)
   opportunity to be involved. Conclusion: Different role-dynamics are at
   play in caregiver-mediated exercises, and it is important for
   participating staff to be aware of their possible effects on the strain
   of patient or caregiver. Caregiver-mediated exercises were found to
   enhance individualization of the treatment plan and preparation for home
   discharge.},

Title = {Implementing Caregiver Support Programs in a Regional Stroke System},
Journal = {STROKE},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Family caregivers play a central role in the
   recovery of people with stroke. They need support to optimize the care
   they provide and their own health and well-being. Despite support from
   the literature and best practice recommendations, healthcare systems are
   not formally adopting caregiver programs. This study aimed to describe
   system-level facilitators and barriers to caregiver support program
   implementation in a regional stroke system.
   Methods-Using a qualitative descriptive study design, focus groups were
   conducted with regional rehabilitation specialists, education
   coordinators, community and long-term care specialists, and
   regional/district program directors. Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with regional medical directors, health professionals
   providing stroke care in acute care, rehabilitation and community
   settings, regional health executives, and primary care leaders. Data
   were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
   Results-Four focus groups (n=43) and 29 interviews were conducted. We
   identified 4 themes related to caregiver program implementation: (1)
   establishing the need for caregiver education and support in an
   integrated healthcare system; (2) incorporating caregiver programs into
   the system of care across the care continuum; (3) uncertainty regarding
   ownership and responsibility for implementation; and (4) addressing
   regional variations related to access, availability, and culture.
   Conclusions-This study provides a comprehensive understanding of
   organization and system-level considerations for implementing caregiver
   programs in a regional stroke system. Program implementation requires
   evidence to establish the need for caregiver programs, practical
   strategies, and establishing ownership to incorporate programs into
   existing healthcare systems, and consideration of regional variations
   across healthcare systems. Ultimately, adopting programs to support
   caregivers will improve recovery in people with stroke and caregiver
   well-being.},

Title = {Quality of life perceptions of family caregivers of older adults stroke
   survivors: A longitudinal study},
Journal = {APPLIED NURSING RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {57-62},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: There are few formal outreach and out-patient support
   services to help family caring for older adults who have had a stroke in
   developing countries. Family caregivers experience negative changes in
   their quality of life.
   Aim: To assess quality of life perceptions of spouse and non-spouse
   caregivers of older adult stroke survivors.
   Methods: A longitudinal survey study. A convenience sample of
   forty-eight family caregivers was recruited from the Special Care Stroke
   Unit at a University Hospital in South Brazil. Quality of life was
   measured using the World Health Organization's Quality of Life BREF
   survey upon discharge from the hospital (Time 1) and two months after
   (Time 2).
   Results: Non-spouse caregivers had the lowest Social Relationship scores
   at Time 1 (p<.001) and at Time 2 (p--=.005), both in terms of personal
   relationship, the quality of their sex lives and support received from
   others.
   Conclusion: Unfortunately, formal community support programs for family
   caregivers in Brazil are lacking. Post-stroke caregiving is largely a
   family affair. Quality of Life assessments among family caregivers of
   older adult stroke survivors are crucial, particularly after discharge.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of
   pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFMEs) done by stroke patients at home in
   line with the health belief model (HBM) on patient care outcomes and
   caregivers' burdens. Method: In the study, a quasi-experimental design
   with a pre- and post-test control group was used. The study was
   conducted with 20 patients in the experimental group and 18 patients in
   the control group. The patients and caregivers were evaluated at
   baseline and after the 12-week PFME intervention performed at home. The
   data were analyzed with the chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed
   rank test and multiple regression analysis. Results: A statistically
   significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the
   mean scores they obtained from the ICIQ-SF and I-QOL, the number of
   urinary incontinence episodes, pad test after interventions and quality
   of life scores (p < 0.05), while no statistically significant difference
   was found between the groups in terms of the mean scores for the Burden
   Interview (p > 0.05). An increase was determined in the self-efficacy of
   the patients in the experimental group after the PFMEs (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Given the results of the present study, it is recommended
   that in the management of post-stroke urinary incontinence, post-stroke
   patients should be encouraged to do PFME at home in line with the HBM,
   and they should be monitored periodically.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The family caregiver's role is an important influence factor of
   patient's adaptation behaviour and quality of life after stroke. The
   purpose of this research was to identify the effect of caregiver
   empowerment program based on the adaptation model (CEP-BAM) on
   functional capacity and quality of life of patients after stroke.
   Methods: This research was a quasi-experimental research with a pre- and
   post-test control group design. The total participants who completed the
   research were 80 patients and their families, 40 participants in the
   intervention group and 40 participants in the control group. We
   conducted home visits to perform the intervention. The measurement of
   functional capacity and quality of life performed four times (pre-test
   and three times post-test). Data analysis was performed using the
   repeated measurement ANOVA or general linear model repeated measure
   (GLM-RM).
   Results: This research proves a significant difference in functional
   capacity and quality of life between the two groups and between pre-test
   and sixth months after intervention (P < 0.05). The quality of life of
   the intervention group in the sixth month after intervention was better
   than that of the control group (33.40 +/- 3.65 vs 30.60 +/- 2.78) with a
   significant difference (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: It is concluded that CEP-BAM effectively increased patients'
   functional capacity and quality of life after a stroke in the sixth
   month after intervention. (c) 2018 Chinese Nursing Association.

Title = {Nursing home care educational intervention for family caregivers of
   older adults post stroke (SHARE): study protocol for a randomised trial},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Background: Family caregivers of aged stroke survivors face challenging
   difficulties such as the lack of support and the knowledge and skills to
   practice home care. These aspects negatively influence the caregivers'
   burden and quality of life, the use of health services, and hospital
   readmissions of the stroke survivor. The aim of this research is to
   describe an educational intervention focused on family caregivers of
   stroke survivors for the development of home care in the south of
   Brazil.
   Methods: A randomized clinical trial with 48 family caregivers of stroke
   survivors will be recruited and divided into two groups: 24 in the
   intervention group and 24 in the control group. The intervention will
   consist of the systematic follow-up by nurses who will perform three
   home visits over a period of 1 month. The control group will not receive
   the visits and will have the usual care guidelines of the health
   services. Primary outcomes: burden and quality of life of the caregiver.
   Secondary outcomes: functional capacity and readmissions of the stroke
   survivors; the use of health services of the stroke survivors and their
   family caregivers. Outcomes will be measured 2 months after discharge.
   The project was approved in April 2016.
   Discussion: This research offers information for conducting educational
   intervention with family caregivers of stroke survivors, presenting
   knowledge so that nurses can structure and plan the actions aimed at the
   education of the family caregiver. It is expected that the educational
   intervention will contribute to reducing caregiver burden and improving
   their quality of life, as well as avoiding readmissions and inadequate
   use of health services by stroke survivors.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the predictive capacity of caregiver availability
   on functional ability at time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation
   in individuals with severe first-time stroke.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of severe stroke
   inpatients admitted to a stroke rehabilitation unit between April 2005
   and December 2009. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with
   patients to determine caregiver availability at time of discharge.
   Hierarchical linear regression analysis was performed to assess the
   predictive capacity of caregiver availability on functional ability at
   discharge from an inpatient rehabilitation unit after controlling for
   covariates.
   Results: Data from 180 individuals were included in the analysis.
   Individuals with a caregiver had significantly higher levels of
   functional ability at discharge compared to those without (85.823.6
   versus 72.920.3; p<0.01), although both groups achieved a minimal
   clinically important difference. After controlling for age, gender,
   admission Functional Independence Measure, and length of hospital stay,
   caregiver availability explained 1.3\% of additional variance, with the
   final model explaining 41.3\% of total variance for functional ability
   at discharge (F(5,174)=26.21, p<0.001).
   Conclusions: The presence of a caregiver at time of discharge from
   inpatient rehabilitation is predictive of significantly higher
   functional ability at discharge in individuals with severe stroke.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPatients with stroke require additional support from family to
   live independently in the area of activities of daily living. Family
   members are usually the main caregivers of stroke patients.
   Comprehensive explanation of ADL handling from family caregivers' view
   is lacking.
   AimThis study explores and describes family caregivers' experiences
   about the strategies to handle activities of daily living (ADL)
   dependency of elderly patient with stroke in the Iranian context.
   MethodA qualitative content analysis approach was conducted to analyse
   data. Nineteen family caregivers participated in the study from multiple
   physiotherapy clinics of physiotherapy in Sari (Iran) between September
   2013 and May 2014. Data were generated through in-depth interviews, and
   content analysis method was used to analyse the data and determine
   themes.
   FindingsThe findings show that family caregivers manage the ADL
   dependency of their elderly stroke patients through seven strategies
   including encouraging physical movements, providing personal hygiene,
   nutritional consideration, facilitating religious activities, filling
   leisure time, and facilitating transfer and assisting in financial
   issues.
   ConclusionFamily has an important role in handling of elderly stroke
   patients' ADL dependency. Health practitioners can take benefit from the
   findings to help the stroke families play more active role in the
   handling ADL dependency of their patients after stroke.},

Title = {Assessing functional communication: validation of the Italian versions
   of the Communication Outcome after Stroke (COAST) scales for speakers
   and caregivers},
Journal = {APHASIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},

Pages = {332-358},
Abstract = {Background: There is an increasing need of assessing functional
   communication in daily activities and the impact on the quality of life
   from the perspective of the major protagonists of life situations
   following aphasia. Several instruments are available for English. One of
   the most recent is the Communication Outcome after Stroke scale for
   patients (COAST) and caregivers (Carer COAST). These scales are
   comprised of two components, interactive communication skills and their
   impact on quality of life, assessed through 20 question items, from the
   point of view of patient and carer. In contrast, the number of tools
   available in Italian is very limited.
   Aims: (i) To validate the COAST and Carer COAST scales for the
   Italian-speaking population; (ii) to explore the applicability of the
   COAST scales to a wider range of people with communication problems, not
   limited to moderate aphasia; (iii) to explore the agreement between
   patient's and carer's perspective on communication difficulties, and the
   effect of severity.
   Methods \& Procedures: The scales were translated into Italian and
   adapted for the sociocultural context, preserving the accessible
   presentation and response format. Thirty people with a history of
   aphasia (from mild to severe) and 28 caregivers provided usable data.
   The scales' psychometric properties were measured, along with
   exploratory analyses on the agreement between patients and carers.
   Outcomes \& Results: The Italian versions of the COAST scales, i. e.,
   COAST-IT and Carer COAST-IT, showed excellent internal consistency (a =
   0.94 and 0.94-0.95, respectively), good test-retest reliability (ICC =
   0.85 and 0.88, respectively), and indicative evidence of construct
   validity as judged by the correlations with measures derived from
   background and current Aachener Aphasia Test (AAT) scores (r ranging
   from 0.32 to 0.41 and from 0.47 to 0.70, respectively). The patient and
   caregiver scales were strongly correlated along the score range (r =
   0.70-0.72) and agreement was not influenced by aphasia severity.
   Conclusions: The COAST-IT and Carer COAST-IT scales are practical and
   reliable patient-and carer-centred measures of functional communication
   and its impact on the quality of life, applicable to people with
   communication problems of different severity. These scales fill an
   important gap of effectiveness indicators for speech-language assessment
   and therapy in Italy. More generally, the results strengthen the need of
   complementing traditional language assessment with functional outcome
   measures, and considering the perspective both of people with
   communication difficulties and their carers. This adaptation could pave
   the way for cross-national sharing of functional communication
   assessment instruments and comparative studies.},

Title = {Identifying reprioritization response shift in a stroke caregiver
   population: a comparison of missing data methods},

Abstract = {Response shift (RS) is an important phenomenon that influences the
   assessment of longitudinal changes in health-related quality of life
   (HRQOL) studies. Given that RS effects are often small, missing data due
   to attrition or item non-response can contribute to failure to detect RS
   effects. Since missing data are often encountered in longitudinal HRQOL
   data, effective strategies to deal with missing data are important to
   consider. This study aims to compare different imputation methods on the
   detection of reprioritization RS in the HRQOL of caregivers of stroke
   survivors.
   Data were from a Canadian multi-center longitudinal study of caregivers
   of stroke survivors over a one-year period. The Stroke Impact Scale
   physical function score at baseline, with a cutoff of 75, was used to
   measure patient stroke severity for the reprioritization RS analysis.
   Mean imputation, likelihood-based expectation-maximization imputation,
   and multiple imputation methods were compared in test procedures based
   on changes in relative importance weights to detect RS in SF-36 domains
   over a 6-month period. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to
   compare the statistical powers of relative importance test procedures
   for detecting RS in incomplete longitudinal data under different missing
   data mechanisms and imputation methods.
   Of the 409 caregivers, 15.9 and 31.3 \% of them had missing data at
   baseline and 6 months, respectively. There were no statistically
   significant changes in relative importance weights on any of the domains
   when complete-case analysis was adopted. But statistical significant
   changes were detected on physical functioning and/or vitality domains
   when mean imputation or EM imputation was adopted. There were also
   statistically significant changes in relative importance weights for
   physical functioning, mental health, and vitality domains when multiple
   imputation method was adopted. Our simulations revealed that relative
   importance test procedures were least powerful under complete-case
   analysis method and most powerful when a mean imputation or multiple
   imputation method was adopted for missing data, regardless of the
   missing data mechanism and proportion of missing data.
   Test procedures based on relative importance measures are sensitive to
   the type and amount of missing data and imputation method. Relative
   importance test procedures based on mean imputation and multiple
   imputation are recommended for detecting RS in incomplete data.},

Title = {Experience of family caregivers of community-dwelling stroke survivors
   and risk of elder abuse: a qualitative study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADULT PROTECTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {276-293},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the following
   questions. First, what are the experiences of family caregivers in
   caring for community-dwelling stroke survivors? Second, what services
   help or do not help the caregivers in managing their caregiving role?
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study was conducted with a
   total of six focus group interviews with 29 stroke caregivers selected
   using convenience sampling in a local community centre. All interviews
   were recorded and transcribed for content analysis.
   Findings - The results pointed to three main themes working together to
   facilitate desirable outcomes in caregiving and prevent elder abuse:
   factors contributing to caregiver stress and factors that have a
   buffering effect on caregiver stress and unmet needs identified from
   caregivers' experiences.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors found that there were a
   number of factors contributing to caregiver stress. The findings matched
   with the concept that caregiver stress should not be considered as the
   primary cause of elder abuse. Findings provided information for further
   research to investigate positive coping and adjustment for stroke
   survivors, caregivers and their families.
   Practical implications - Policy makers and service providers may
   consider specific policies and tailor-made services to enhance the
   effectiveness of current practice. The themes emerging from the study
   could be further reviewed in a longitudinal way to explore the
   cost-effectiveness, the outcomes and trajectory of interventional
   programmes.
   Social implications -Education would be essential to let the public
   understand caregivers' difficulties and needs. Prevention of elder abuse
   may be approached with a range of risk factors for both perpetrating and
   being elder abuse victim.
   Originality/value - From the findings of the study, the authors found
   that there were service gaps within policy and interventions. Concrete
   suggestions for improving the public's attitude and public facilities/
   transport for the disabled were captured in the study. In addition to
   personal resilience, caregivers had a strong wish for a supportive
   environment and services that would facilitate a better caregiving
   outcome.},

Title = {Assessment of the Needs of Caregivers of Stroke Patients at State-Owned
   Acute-Care Hospitals in Southern Vietnam, 2011},
Journal = {PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Care for stroke patients has improved steadily in southern Vietnam.
   Medical treatments such as thrombolytic therapy have been implemented at
   several hospitals, and stroke-care units composed of a team of various
   health professionals have been created. However, little attention has
   been focused on providing support to caregivers of stroke patients. This
   study aimed to characterize the caregivers of stroke patients who were
   treated in state-owned acute-care hospitals and to learn about their
   needs when patients are discharged. Such information can be used to
   enhance the caregiver's support system.
   Methods
   We used questionnaires to conduct a descriptive study in 2011 at a
   state-owned acute-care hospital in southern Vietnam. We recruited study
   participants from among caregivers of stroke patients who had been
   informed of their hospital discharge date. We assessed 8 caregiver
   characteristics, and caregiver participants selected their needs from
   the survey's list of 15 possible needs. We analyzed the data by using
   the independent sample t test and logistic regression.
   Results
   Of the 93 caregivers who consented to participate, 86 (92.5\%) completed
   the survey and indicated their concerns at discharge. The most
   frequently cited need was information on how to prevent stroke
   recurrence (72, 83.7\%), followed by which drugs are most effective in
   preventing a relapse (62, 72.1\%), how long recovery would take (61,
   70.9\%), and availability of hospitals in the patient's hometown (60,
   69.8\%). A little over half of caregivers indicated financial concerns.
   A caregiver's need for information on diet for a stroke survivor
   increased with the caregiver's education level.
   Conclusions
   This study revealed several needs among caregivers of stroke survivors
   in southern Vietnam that are similar to those found by studies of
   caregivers of stroke survivors in high-income countries. Our findings
   suggest that comprehensive stroke care that includes caregiver education
   about healthful diets and prevention of stroke recurrence is needed at
   state-owned acute-care hospitals in southern Vietnam.},

Abstract = {Objective: This research was conducted as a descriptive study, in order
   to determine the level of burden in the caregiving tasks undertaken by
   the relatives of stroke patients.
   Material and Method: This study included the relatives of 70 elderly
   stroke patients who had presented to the neurology and physical therapy
   and rehabilitation clinics in a university hospital in Ankara, Turkey.
   After a review of the relevant literature, study data were collected
   using a form prepared for both the patient and caregiver. The Rivermead
   Mobility Index (RMI) and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (Burden
   Interview) were also used.
   Results: The Caregiver Burden Scale point average of the caregivers
   participating in our research was determined as 42.5. The difference
   between the points received by the patients from the RMI and the point
   average of the caregiver burden was statistically significant (p< 0.05).
   The difference between the point average of the caregivers who assist
   patients with nutrition, motion, and excretion tasks was found to be
   statistically significant (p< 0.05). The difference between the
   caregiving burden point average of caregivers with family difficulties
   related to caregiving, and whose daily lives were affected, was found to
   be statistically significant (p< 0.05).
   Discussion: In conclusion with the results of the research, suggestions
   were offered to make discharge training more effective, arrange training
   and consultancy programs aimed at coping with the problems experienced
   by the caregivers, and provide the required institutional support.},

Abstract = {Objective: The study was designed to determine the burden of caregivers
   of stroke patients and the factors affecting the burden.
   Methods: This descriptive research was conducted at Turkey Izmir Ataturk
   Education and Research Hospital, Clinic for Neurology with the
   participation of 80 caregivers who agreed to take part in the research
   between January 15 and March 15, 2007. Data were collected using an
   introductory information form and the Caregiver Burden Inventory.
   Results: The average Caregiver Burden Inventory subscales scores were
   time-addiction burden 15.31 +/- 4.07, developmental burden 8.19 +/-
   4.46, physical burden 6.88 +/- 3.93, social burden 5.55 +/- 4.40,
   emotional burden 3.44 +/- 4.25. The average total burden score was 39.36
   +/- 13.83. There was found relationship between the ages of caregivers
   and the time-addiction burden; the social security and emotional and
   total burden; the requesting state to receive caregiver training and
   emotional burden; and the encountered difficulties in coping strategies
   and the average score for the physical burden subscale (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: In accordance with the aforementioned results, it has been
   concluded that taking care of a family member in need is perceived as a
   task and responsibility in Turkish society. Parallel to this, caregivers
   are not aware of their burden throughout the process and have difficulty
   in expressing the hardships they experience.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this brief report was to estimate the program costs for
   the Telephone Assessment and Skill-building Kit (TASK) for stroke
   caregivers, in comparison with an Information, Support, and Referral
   (ISR) group. Using data from our pilot trial, we developed a cost
   template, accounting for both the costs of organizing and implementing
   the TASK intervention and ISR programs and costs of the caregiver's time
   involved. Mean costs per caregiver were estimated to be \$421 in the
   TASK intervention group, compared with \$286 in the ISR group. This
   difference was largely due to extended training time and longer
   durations of phone calls in the TASK group. In addition to reporting our
   findings, we highlighted the general process of properly identifying,
   measuring, and valuing resource use in a caregiver intervention and
   discussed several ways a cost template can inform the evaluation and
   decision-making processes in nurse-led programs.},

Abstract = {Stroke may bring about various impacts on functional deficits to people
   with stroke, as well as caregiving stress. The present study aims at
   exploring the relationship between the demographic characteristics of 33
   caregivers and the stress experienced plus their implications for
   rehabilitation. The patients' admission scores on the Chinese
   Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE), modified Barthel Index (MBI), and
   Relatives' Stress Scales (RSS) of caregivers were collected. It was
   found that older caregivers would experience more stress, while better
   independence and functioning of patients suggested lower personal
   distress. Admission Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination scores of
   patients had a negative correlation with the negative feeling subscale
   of Relatives' Stress Scales, implying that a higher level of stroke
   patients' dependence on the daily activity and reduction in physical
   ability of caregivers may hint at a higher level of personal distress
   for caregivers. Cognitive deficits of patients may also induce emotional
   distress for caregivers. Proper handling techniques and caregiving
   skills for the people with cognitive deficits and higher daily activity
   dependence are suggested for better management.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify the reasons for the provision of
   informal rehabilitation services at home to stroke relatives by Thai
   caregivers. Twenty primary informal caregivers were individually
   interviewed at their homes by using semistructured questions elaborated
   by the researchers. All interviews were recorded on audiotape. Content
   analysis was used to determine the reasons for performing informal
   rehabilitation. Four major reasons, (i) biological, (ii) psychological,
   (iii) social, and (iv) spiritual, emerged from our content analysis to
   maintain for the stroke victims the highest possible quality of life.
   Improvement and prevention of further deterioration were the two main
   concepts in the biological and psychological reasons expressed by these
   Thai caregivers, whereas maintaining human relations and usual social
   activities were the two main considerations in the social reason. The
   main concepts in the spiritual reason were respecting the religious
   beliefs, superstitions, and culture of the caregivers or patients,
   improving patients' empowerment, and improving caregivers' satisfaction.
   These four reasons encompassed the biological, psychological, social,
   and spiritual aspects of,a holistic approach to the definition of
   health. The health professional in Thailand should encourage stroke
   caregivers to continue providing informal rehabilitation services for
   their stroke relatives, as it might sustain the well being of stroke
   survivors during their stay at home.},

Abstract = {Our aim was to explore the informal rehabilitation activities performed
   by Thai caregivers for stroke survivors at home. Twenty primary informal
   caregivers; were individually interviewed, using semi-structured
   questions developed by researchers, to investigate the informal
   rehabilitation activities provided for the stroke survivors at their
   homes. All interviews were audiotape recorded and some pictures of
   rehabilitation activities were taken during data collection. The data
   collected underwent content analysis. Findings revealed three major
   categories of rehabilitation activities - biological, psychological and
   social rehabilitation. Biological rehabilitation was the most frequently
   undertaken by all Thai caregivers. Several methods were used to
   rehabilitate the stroke survivors in each category, based on the
   scientific background and cultural beliefs of the caregivers and
   survivors. In conclusion, informal caregivers always have in mind all
   activities, thus providing a holistic approach for informal
   rehabilitation. This plays a very significant role in minimizing
   residual disabilities, preventing related complications and sustaining
   the well-being of stroke survivors. Health professionals should motivate
   caregivers of stroke survivors to maintain informal rehabilitation
   activity at home. Additionally, health care providers should be
   concerned about the coordination between institutional and informal
   rehabilitation in order to better optimize the quality of care provided
   at home.},

Title = {Caregiver burden and coping strategies in caregivers of older patients
   with stroke},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Background: Coping strategies play a key role in modulating the physical
   and psychological burden on caregivers of stroke patients. The present
   study aimed to determine the relationship between the severity of burden
   of care and coping strategies amongst a sample of Iranian caregivers of
   older stroke patients. It also aimed to examine the differences of
   coping strategies used by male and female caregivers.
   Methods: A total of 110 caregivers of older patients who previously had
   a stroke participated in this descriptive and cross-sectional study. The
   Zarit Burden Interview and Lazarus coping strategies questionnaires were
   used for data collection. Questionnaires were completed by the
   caregivers, who were selected using convenience sampling. The collected
   data were analyzed using Pearson's correlations and independent t-tests.
   Results: The mean age of participants was 32.09 +/- 8.70 years. The
   majority of the caregivers sampled reported mild to moderate (n = 74,
   67.3\%) burden. The most commonly used coping strategies reported were
   positive reappraisal and seeking social support. Results of the
   independent t-test showed that male caregivers used the positive
   reappraisal strategy (t(110) = 2.76; p = 0.007) and accepting
   responsibility (t(110) = 2.26; p=0.026) significantly more than female
   caregivers. Pearson's correlations showed a significant positive
   correlation between caregiver burden and emotional-focused strategies,
   including escaping (r = 0.245, p = 0.010) and distancing (r = 0.204, p =
   0.032).
   Conclusions: Caregivers with higher burden of care used more negative
   coping strategies, such as escape-avoidance and distancing. In order to
   encourage caregivers to utilize effective coping skills, appropriate
   programs should be designed and implemented to support caregivers. Use
   of effective coping skills to reduce the level of personal burden can
   improve caregiver physical health and psychological well-being.},

Title = {Positive effects of resilience and self-efficacy on World Health
   Organization Quality of Life Instrument score among caregivers of stroke

Abstract = {Aim Stroke is one of the major health challenges affecting life
   expectancy and quality of life around the world. However, there is
   limited reporting on the status of some caregivers, including Chinese
   caregivers of stroke inpatients. Limited information is available on
   evaluations using the World Health Organization Quality of Life
   Instrument (WHOQOL) and the effects of resilience and self-efficacy on
   WHOQOL score. Therefore, we conducted research to assess the role of
   resilience on the WHOQOL and to investigate the role of self-efficacy as
   a mediator between resilience and WHOQOL score among Chinese caregivers
   of stroke inpatients.
   Methods This cross-sectional study to gather data from north-east and
   south-east China was conducted from June 2019 to October 2019. Over 380
   caregivers of stroke inpatients at two general public hospitals were
   interviewed face-to-face. About 305 caregivers (80.26\%) completed the
   questionnaire, which included the Ego Resilience Scale, the General
   Self-Efficacy Scale, and the brief version of the WHOQOL and asked about
   demographic characteristics. This study also examined factors associated
   with WHOQOL score and used linear regression analysis and structure
   equation modelling to construct direct and indirect models,
   respectively.
   Results After adjustment for demographic characteristics, both
   resilience and self-efficacy were positively associated with all WHOQOL
   domains. Structure equation modelling revealed that self-efficacy
   mediated the relationship between resilience and WHOQOL score among
   caregivers of stroke inpatients.
   Conclusion Chinese caregivers of stroke inpatients exhibited good social
   health but poor physical, psychological, and environmental health. It is
   necessary for promoting resilience and improving WHOQOL score through
   the mediating effect of self-efficacy. These results suggest that
   interventions in health care focused on both enhancing resilience and
   providing self-efficacy training could effectively improve WHOQOL score.},

Abstract = {Family caregivers exhibit a wide variety of needs and concerns while
   providing care to stroke survivors after discharge to the home setting.
   We report the results of two related studies utilizing a multimethod
   design in which stroke family caregivers (N = 12;N = 10) were
   interviewed using open-ended questions, followed by written caregiver
   ratings regarding the types of telehealth technologies they preferred
   for the telephone assessment and skill-building kit (TASK III).
   Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis procedures with a
   provisional ``start list{''} of codes in a matrix template based on the
   types of telehealth technologies in the rating forms. Descriptive
   statistics were used to analyze ratings with response scales ranging
   from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Average ratings for
   the telehealth technologies for the TASK III resource guide were
   obtained for the mailed hard copy binder (M = 3.58-4.13;SD = 0.35-1.00),
   an interactive website (;M = 3.86-4.17;SD = .72-1.07), an eBook (M =
   3.17-3.67;SD = 0.84-1.17), and a USB drive (M = 3.75-4.00;SD = .82-.96).
   Average ratings for the telehealth technologies for the TASK III calls
   with the nurse were obtained for the use of a telephone (M =
   4.36-5.00;SD = 0.00-0.89), FaceTime on an iOS device (e.g., iPhone or
   iPad;M = 3.73-4.40;SD = 0.79-0.98), or online videoconferencing (M =
   3.17-3.50;SD = 0.82-1.47). Qualitative data revealed a wide variety of
   preferences for each type of telehealth technology, with advantages and
   disadvantages of each. The findings underscored the importance of
   offering multiple telehealth technology options to stroke family
   caregivers. Future studies are recommended that employ randomized
   control trial methodology to test theoretically-based interventions that
   are based on stroke family caregiver preferences for telehealth
   technologies.},

Abstract = {Objective: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of an Internet and
   telephone support and problem-solving intervention for stroke
   caregivers. Design: Randomized controlled pilot trial with four arms:
   four-week intervention (n = 13), eight-week intervention (n = 13),
   eight-week attention control (n = 13), and standard care (n = 14).
   Setting: Southeastern U.S. Veterans Health System. Participants:
   Informal caregivers of Veterans who suffered a stroke in the preceding
   2.5 years were enrolled over an 18-month period. Interventions:
   Intervention participants received RESCUE, a support and problem-solving
   intervention delivered via telephone and Internet by registered nurses.
   Attention control participants received active listening with no advice
   delivered by nurses via telephone. Main Measures: Feasibility of a
   larger trial was assessed via recruitment and retention. Acceptability
   was assessed using an adapted enactment tool and qualitative interviews.
   Changes in caregiver depressive symptoms and burden were measured by the
   Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Zarit Burden
   Interview. The study was not powered for significance testing. Results:
   Of 340 eligible caregivers, 53 (16\%) agreed to participate. Among those
   enrolled, 51 (96\%) completed the study. Caregiver mean age was 60.3
   (10.1), 49 (93\%) were female and 36 (68\%) were white. At baseline, 21
   (39\%) caregivers had high risk of depression and 18 (33\%) had
   significant burden. Acceptability and enactment tool findings indicated
   positive participant responses to the intervention. Most rated the
   amount of sessions the ``right amount{''}. Qualitative analysis revealed
   the intervention was valued by and acceptable to caregivers.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate the RESCUE intervention is feasible and
   acceptable to caregivers and warrants further testing.},

Title = {Dyadic approach to supervised community rehabilitation participation in
   an Asian setting post-stroke: exploring the role of caregiver and

Abstract = {Objective To study the association of caregiver factors and stroke
   survivor factors with supervised community rehabilitation (SCR)
   participation over the first 3 months and subsequent 3 to 12 months
   post-stroke in an Asian setting.
   Design Prospective cohort study.
   Setting Community setting.
   Participants We recruited stroke survivors and their caregivers into our
   yearlong cohort. Caregiver and stroke survivor variables were collected
   over 3-monthly intervals. We performed logistic regression with the
   outcome variable being SCR participation post-stroke.
   Outcome measures SCR participation over the first 3 months and
   subsequent 3 to 12 months post-stroke
   Results 251 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads were available for the
   current analysis. The mean age of caregivers was 50.1 years, with the
   majority being female, married and co-residing with the stroke survivor.
   There were 61\%, 28\%, 4\% and 7\% of spousal, adult-child, sibling and
   other caregivers. The odds of SCR participation decreased by about 15\%
   for every unit increase in caregiver-reported stroke survivor's
   disruptive behaviour score (OR: 0.845; 95\% CI: 0.769 to 0.929). For
   every 1-unit increase in the caregiver's positive management strategy
   score, the odds of using SCR service increased by about 4\% (OR: 1.039;
   95\% CI: 1.011 to 1.068).
   Conclusion We established that SCR participation is jointly determined
   by both caregiver and stroke survivor factors, with factors varying over
   the early and late post-stroke period. Our results support the adoption
   of a dyadic or more inclusive approach for studying the utilisation of
   community rehabilitation services, giving due consideration to both the
   stroke survivors and their caregivers. Adopting a stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyadic approach in practice settings should include
   promotion of positive care management strategies, comprehensive
   caregiving training including both physical and behavioural dimensions,
   active engagement of caregivers in rehabilitation journey and conducting
   regular caregiver needs assessments in the community.},

Title = {A nurse-led health coaching intervention for stroke survivors and their
   family caregivers in hospital to home transition care in Chongqing,
   China: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {TRIALS},

Abstract = {Background Hospital to home transition care is a most stressful period
   for stroke survivors and their caregivers to learn self-management of
   stroke-related health conditions and to engage in rehabilitation. Health
   coaching has been identified as a strategy to enhance self-management of
   poststroke care at home. However, interventions in this field that are
   informed by a health coaching framework are scarce. This study will
   address a gap in research by testing the hypothesis that a nurse-led
   health coaching intervention can improve health outcomes for stroke
   survivors and their family caregivers in hospital to home transition
   care. Methods This is a single-blind, two-arm parallel randomized
   controlled trial of a nurse-led health coaching program versus routine
   care situated in two tertiary hospitals in Chongqing, China. Stroke
   survivors and their primary family caregivers will be recruited together
   as ``participant dyads{''}, and the estimated sample size is 140 (70 in
   each group). The intervention includes a 12-week nurse-led health
   coaching program in hospital to home transition care commencing at
   discharge from the hospital. The primary outcome is changes in
   self-efficacy of stroke survivors at 12 weeks from the baseline. The
   secondary outcomes are changes in stroke survivors' and quality of life,
   functional ability, stroke-related knowledge, the number of adverse
   events, and unplanned hospital admissions, and caregivers' self-efficacy
   and caregiver-related burden at 12 weeks from the baseline. The outcomes
   will be measured at 12 weeks and 24 weeks from the baseline. Discussion
   This study will examine the effect of nurse-led health coaching on
   hospital to home transition care for stroke survivors and their
   caregivers. It is anticipated that findings from this trial will provide
   research evidence to inform policy, and resource and practice
   development to improve hospital to home transition care for stroke
   survivors and their caregivers.},

Title = {Informal caregivers in stroke: Life impact, support, and psychological
   well-being-A Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke) study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background
   Informal caregivers provide a large amount of day-to-day assistance and
   are crucial for the ability of survivors to recover and adapt to life
   after stroke.
   Aim
   The development of caregiver support programs is limited by lack of
   large long-term follow-up studies. We present a comprehensive study of
   Swedish stroke caregivers' life situation in relation to degree of
   functional dependency of the survivor.
   Patients and methods
   In 2016, the Swedish Stroke Register, Riksstroke, conducted a long-term
   follow-up survey on caregivers to patients with stroke three and five
   years earlier. Items on psychological well-being were adapted from the
   36-item short-form health survey and poor outcome was defined using the
   36-item short-form health survey reference material. Survivor degree of
   dependency was indicated by the caregiver as independent, partially
   dependent, or completely dependent.
   Results
   A total of 5063 community dwelling dyads were included: 56.5\% of
   survivors were independent, 33.4\% partially dependent, and 10.1\%
   completely dependent. Caregiver life impact, need of support, and
   proportion of poor psychological well-being increased incrementally with
   survivor degree of dependency. In the completely dependent group where
   41.1\% of survivors could not be left unattended for more than 1 h,
   23.7\% of caregivers expressed unmet need of caregiver support; 51.4\%
   reported poor psychological well-being compared to 19.3\% in the
   independent group.
   Conclusion
   The caregiver situation varies greatly with degree of survivor
   dependency which makes generalizations of caregiver needs difficult. Our
   results emphasize the need for integrating support aimed specifically at
   caregivers to survivors of stroke with a large degree of dependency.},

Abstract = {Background: Pakistan is the sixth most populous nation in the world and
   has an estimated 4 million stroke survivors. Most survivors are taken
   care of by community-based caregivers, and there are no inpatient
   rehabilitation facilities.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness
   and safety of locally designed 5-min movies rolled out in order of
   relevance that are thematically delivered in a 3-month program to
   deliver poststroke education to stroke survivor and caregiver dyads
   returning to the community.
   Methods: This study was a randomized controlled, outcome
   assessor-blinded, parallel group, single-center superiority trial in
   which participants (stroke survivor-caregiver dyads) with first-ever
   stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) incidence were randomized within
   48 hours of their stroke into either the video-based education
   intervention group or the control group. The video-based education
   intervention group had health education delivered through short videos
   that were shown to the participants and their caregivers at the time of
   admission, before discharge, and the first and third months of follow-up
   after discharge. The control group had standardized care including
   predischarge education and counseling according to defined protocols.
   All participants enrolled in the video education intervention and
   control groups were followed for 12 months after discharge for outcome
   assessment in the outpatient stroke clinics. The primary outcome
   measures were the proportion of participants achieving control of blood
   pressure, blood sugar, and blood cholesterol in the video intervention
   versus the control group. Several predefined secondary outcomes were
   included in this study, of which we report the mortality and functional
   disability in this paper. Analysis was by performed using the
   intention-to-treat principle.
   Results: A total of 310 stroke survivors and their caregiver dyads
   (participant dyads) were recruited over a duration of 6 months. In
   total, 155 participant dyads were randomized into the intervention and
   control groups, each. The primary outcome of control of three major risk
   factors revealed that at 12 months, there was a greater percentage of
   participants with a systolic BP<125 mm Hg (18/54, 33\% vs 11/52, 21\%;
   P=.16), diastolic BP<85 mm Hg (44/54, 81\% vs 37/52, 71\%; P=.21),
   HbA(1c) level<7\% (36/55, 65\% vs 30/40, 75\%; P=.32), and low-density
   lipoprotein level<100 mg/dL (36/51, 70\% vs 30/45, 67\%; P=.68) in the
   intervention group than in the control group. The secondary outcome
   reported is the mortality among the stroke survivors because the number
   of stroke-related complications was higher in the control group than in
   the intervention group (13/155, 8.4\% vs 2/155, 1.3\%), and this
   difference was statistically significant (P<.001).
   Conclusions: The Movies4Stroke trial failed to achieve its primary
   specified outcome. However, secondary outcomes that directly related to
   survival skills of stroke survivors demonstrated the effectiveness of
   the video-based intervention on improving stroke-related mortality and
   survival without disability.},

Abstract = {(1) Background: Swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) after stroke are not
   uncommon and is a consistent risk factor for stroke-associated
   pneumonia. This interview study explores the perspectives of stroke
   survivors, who had their swallowing assessed in the first few days of
   admission to hospital, and their informal caregivers. (2) Methods: A
   participatory approach was used involving people affected by stroke in
   the interpretation and analysis of the interview data. Data was
   thematically analysed and six themes were identified. (3) Results: These
   themes included how past-future experiences may influence a person's
   emotional response to events; understanding what is happening and
   adjustment; the impact of dysphagia; attitudes to care; communication to
   patients and procedural issues. (4) Conclusion: The findings highlight
   the importance of effective public health messages to improve people's
   responsiveness to the signs of stroke, standardisation of assessment and
   management procedures, effective communication to patients about the
   consequences of dysphagia, and the impact of dysphagia on the person who
   had the stroke and their informal caregiver.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the awareness/knowledge of stroke risk factors and
   warning signs among caregivers of patients with or without stroke.
   Methods: The cross-sectional, descriptive and comparative study was
   conducted in the neurology clinic and polyclinic of a university
   hospital in Izmir, Turkey, from March to July 2014, and comprised
   primary caregivers of patients with stroke in group 1 and those of
   patients with no stroke in group 2. The subjects were screened and data
   was collected using the Participant Information Form and the
   Questionnaire Form About Stroke. Warning signs and symptoms of stroke
   were compared between the two sets of caregivers. SPSS 17was used for
   data analysis.
   Results: Of the 203 respondents, 105(52\%) were in group 1 and 98(48\%)
   in group 2. Group 1 had better awareness than group 2 (p<0.05). In group
   1, weakness was the most commonly recognised warning sign 101(96.2\%),
   whereas dyspnoea 41(39\%), was the least commonly identified. There was
   no relationship of stroke knowledge with educational level and age
   (p>0.05 each).
   Conclusion: Caregivers had a moderate knowledge of some of the warning
   signs and risk factors about stroke.},

Abstract = {Background: The unique perspectives of patients and caregivers on their
   experiences as users of rehabilitation services help identify areas for
   improvement for the continuum from acute care to community integration.
   Objective: This study reports perceptions of persons with stroke and
   their caregivers in an existing continuum of stroke care, social
   services, and rehabilitation in the Province of Quebec. Methods: A total
   of 10 focus groups were held, 5 with persons with stroke (n = 37, mean
   age 59.6 years (SD = 11.6); 21 men) and 5 others with caregivers (n =
   31; mean age 58.8 years (SD = 15.1); 8 men). Discussions were
   transcribed and were the object of thematic content analysis using
   Nvivo. Results: Participants expressed their general satisfaction toward
   the care received in inpatient, hospital, and rehabilitation settings.
   The information received about acute care, however, was deemed
   insufficient and fragmented, and access of rehabilitation services was
   often perceived to be difficult. In the community integration phase of
   the continuum, most participants stated that they had experienced poor
   accessibility to services of any kind. Conclusions: Persons with stroke
   and their relatives' perspectives about the services that they obtained
   throughout the rehabilitation continuum vary importantly according to
   the services examined. Adopting a continuum perspective is helpful to
   target priorities for improvement.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors experience long-term physical, psychosocial
   and cognitive impairment that are formidable challenges to caregivers
   because caring for stroke survivors needs explicit knowledge and
   caregivers have to endure the stressfulness as a result of caring. In
   addition, little is known about perceived benefits of the stroke care
   giving experience. Objectives: This study was aimed to determine the
   caregivers' burden and challenges as reported by caregivers of stroke
   survivors. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study
   involving 18 stroke caregivers. The data were collected from November
   2015 to June 2016 at a conveniently selected community rehabilitation
   centre in Kuching, Sarawak. Results: The qualitative data analysis
   revealed that the burden was aggravated by financial problems, multiple
   responsibilities hold by the caregivers, behavioural changes of the
   stroke survivors and lack of social support during care giving.
   Conclusion: This study highlighted the experiences by the caregivers in
   caring for the stroke survivors that focused on the different needs of
   the caregivers. Understanding these experiences may help the service
   providers to provide better support and resources for caregivers in
   caring for stroke survivors.},

Abstract = {Our aim was to explore the independent attribution of Post-stroke
   depression (PSD) to caregiver burden of acute ischemic stroke patients.
   A cross-sectional survey was performed with 271 acute ischemic stroke
   patients in the Huai-He Hospital and First People's Hospital of Kaifeng
   City in China. PSD was assessed by Self-rating Depressive Scale, and
   caregiver burden was assessed by Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview.
   Clustered logistic regression was applied to identify the impact of PSD
   on caregiver burden. As results, female patients, normal muscle strength
   and PSD were associated with caregiver burden. PSD correlated with an
   independent influence of 17.2\% on the risk of caregiver burden, The
   independent influence of PSD on caregiver burden was smaller than that
   of social-demographics of caregivers and clinical factors of stroke
   patients This study suggests that PSD may have a modest influence on
   caregiver burden.},

Abstract = {Objective: To delineate positive aspects of caregiving trajectories
   among family caregivers of stroke-survivors and determine the impact of
   stroke-survivor disability, a time-varying factor, on the delineated
   trajectories.
   Methods: In a longitudinal study, family caregivers of 173
   stroke-survivors in Singapore were administered the Positive Aspects of
   Caregiving scale (PAC scale) thrice (baseline/3 months/6 months).
   Group-based trajectory modeling delineated positive aspects of
   caregiving trajectories and identified the impact of stroke-survivor
   disability on the trajectories.
   Results: Two distinct positive aspects of caregiving trajectories,
   Persistently Low and Persistently High were delineated. Increase in
   stroke-survivor disability was associated with a significant downward
   shift (reduction in positive aspects of caregiving) of the Persistently
   Low trajectory and a significant upward shift (increase in positive
   aspects of caregiving) of the Persistently High trajectory. Older
   caregivers were more likely to follow the Persistently High trajectory.
   Conclusions: Care professionals should be mindful of the heterogeneity
   in the longitudinal pattern of positive feelings resulting from care
   provision among family caregivers of stroke-survivors, and the
   differential impact of stroke-survivor disability on the pattern of
   positive feelings. Younger caregivers as well as family caregivers who
   have low positive feelings at the start of their caregiver journey and
   experience worsening functional disability of their care recipient
   (stroke-survivor) require greater attention and support.},

Abstract = {Many factors influence pre-hospital delays in the event of stroke. This
   study aimed to develop and evaluate a comprehensive educational program
   for decreasing pre-hospital delays in high-risk stroke population.
   We enrolled 220 high-risk stroke population and caregivers from six
   urban communities in Harbin from May 2013 to May 2015, and randomly
   divided them into intervention and control groups. We implemented a
   comprehensive educational program (intervention group), comprising
   public lectures, instructional brochures, case videos, simulations, and
   role-playing from May 2013 to May 2015. We delivered conventional oral
   education in the control group. We compared stroke pre-hospital delay
   behavioral intention (SPDBI), pre-hospital stroke symptom coping test
   (PSSCT), and stroke pre-symptoms alert test (SPSAT) results between the
   groups before and 6, 12, and 18 months after health intervention.
   There were significant differences between before and after intervention
   (P < 0.01). SPDBI, PSSCT, and SPSAT scores were significantly different
   between the groups (P < 0.01). The interaction between time and
   intervention method was significant (P < 0.01). According to
   multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance, SPDBI, PSSCT, and
   SPSAT scores were significantly different at each time after
   intervention (P < 0.05).
   The comprehensive educational program was significantly effective in
   decreasing SPDBI, improving knowledge, enhancing stroke pre-symptoms
   alert, and reducing the possibility of pre-hospital delays.},

Title = {Development and psychometric properties of ECPICID-AVC to measure
   informal caregivers' skills when caring for older stroke survivors at

Abstract = {Introduction: Informal caregivers provide a significant part of the
   total care needed by dependent older people post-stroke. Although
   informal care is often the preferred option of those who provide and
   those who receive informal care, informal caregivers often report lack
   of preparation to take care of older dependent people. This article
   outlines the development and psychometric testing of informal
   caregivers' skills when providing care to older people after a stroke -
   ECPICID-AVC.
   Design: Prospective psychometric instrument validation study.
   Methods: Eleven experts participated in a focus group in order to
   delineate, develop and validate the instrument. Data were gathered among
   adult informal caregivers (n = 186) living in the community in Northern
   Portugal from August 2013 to January 2014.
   Results: The 32-item scale describes several aspects of informal
   caregiver's skills. The scale has eight factors: skill to feed/hydrate
   by nasogastric feeding, skill to assist the person in personal hygiene,
   skill to assist the person for transferring, skill to assist the person
   for positioning, skill to provide technical aids, skill to assist the
   person to use the toilet, skill to feed/hydrate and skill to provide
   technical aids for dressing/undressing. Analysis demonstrated adequate
   internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83) and good temporal
   stability 0.988 (0.984-0.991).
   Conclusion: The psychometric properties of the measurement tool showed
   acceptable results allowing its implementation in clinical practice by
   the nursing community staff for evaluating practical skills in informal
   caregivers when providing care to older stroke survivors living at home.},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of home-based oral care
   training programs on tongue coating (TC), dental plaque (DP), and
   symptoms of respiratory infection (SRI) in stroke survivors. Methods: A
   single-blind, randomised, controlled trial conducted in a home-based
   setting over 2 months. Stroke survivors (n= 48, experimental group) and
   their family caregivers received home-based oral care training programme
   while a control group of 46 stroke survivors and family caregivers
   received routine oral care education with swabs. TC, DP, and SRI were
   assessed at baseline and after one and two months, with results analysed
   using Mixed Model ANOVA. Results: Poor oral hygiene and overall neglect
   of home oral care practices were observed at baseline. TC and DP scores
   were significantly reduced in the experimental group receiving the
   home-base oral care training program compared to the control group, who
   received only routine oral care education (P<0.001). The groupxtime
   interaction was significant, with decreased TC and DP scores for both
   groups at one month and at two months of additional care (when compared
   to baseline). The SRI scores were not significantly different between
   groups (P>0.05). The groupxtime interaction did not correlate with SRI
   for either group when compared to the baseline and to one month and two
   months of additional care. No adverse events were encountered and there
   was no external funding. Conclusions: Home-based oral care training
   programme had a beneficial effect on oral health as measured by TC and
   DP scores. The effect on SRI requires further longitudinal study.},

Abstract = {PurposeTo explore possible extended benefits to caregivers of stroke
   survivors receiving a treatment of onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) or saline
   with a structured exercise program.
   DesignA comparative, prospective, companion study using a nonrandom
   sample of 16 caregivers of stroke survivors enrolled in a pilot clinical
   trial comparing BTX-A or saline and exercise for upper extremity
   spasticity.
   MethodsThe caregiver measures were depressive symptoms, care demands,
   family conflict surrounding stroke recovery, and mental and physical
   health status.
   FindingsThere were no statistically significant differences between
   caregiver groups. Caregivers of stroke survivors who received BTX-A had
   a greater change in depressive symptoms that may reflect a clinically
   important change. Estimates of effect sizes between the groups,
   controlling for baseline values, indicate a trend for moderate to large
   effects (last evaluation) for fewer depressive symptoms (d=0.52) and
   less caregiver burden (d=0.77 time, 0.85 difficulty) for caregivers of
   the BTX-A group.
   Conclusions and Clinical RelevanceReceiving BTX-A did not alter
   caregiving demands or depressive symptoms compared to those receiving
   saline. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to better
   understand the interdependence of stroke survivors and caregivers on the
   health of each.},

Abstract = {Background: Approximately 800 000 people experience a stroke every year;
   most are cared for by unpaid family members in home settings. Web-based
   interventions provide 24/7 access to education/support services and have
   been explored in the literature with family caregivers dealing with
   chronic conditions. Current research into nurses' web-based interactions
   with caregivers in these interventions is lacking.
   Objective: The aim of this qualitative secondary data analysis was to
   examine a nurse specialist's responses and advice that she gave in a
   web-based supportive intervention for stroke family caregivers used in a
   randomized controlled trial for 1 year.
   Methods: Using a qualitative research design, caregivers were recruited
   from rehabilitation facilities in Ohio and Michigan (n=36). They
   accessed the intervention's email forum and discussion group facilitated
   by the nurse. These email message data were examined using rigorous
   content analysis.
   Results: The caregivers were primarily white women caring for a spouse,
   with an average age of 54 years. From the 2148 email messages between
   the nurse and caregivers, five themes emerged and were drawn to
   Friedemann's Framework. These themes included: getting to know the
   situation (Friedemann's coherence and individuation), validating
   emotions (individuation), promoting self-care (individuation), assisting
   in role adaptation (system maintenance and individuation), and providing
   healthcare information (system maintenance and individuation).
   Conclusions: These caregivers of stroke survivors were asking for
   advice, seeking support, and looking for information from an advanced
   practice nurse. Nurses, and others, in supportive roles can use these

Title = {Level of Caregiver Burden in Jamaican Stroke Caregivers and Relationship

Abstract = {Objective: This study sought to determine the level of caregiver burden
   present in Jamaican stroke caregivers and to investigate the
   relationship between caregiver burden and selected sociodemographic
   variables.
   Method: The Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale and a demographic sheet were
   administered to the caregivers. The stroke survivors completed the
   Barthel Index and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Interview
   administration was used for all tools.
   Results: A total of 48 caregivers with their stroke survivors
   participated in this study. Preliminary findings showed that caregivers
   of stroke survivors in Jamaica are experiencing some level of burden
   with scores ranging from 21 to 62 (mean = 43.64 +/- 8.73). Lower burden
   scores indicate greater burden. Caregivers of female stroke survivors
   had significantly greater levels of burden (43.5 +/- 8.87) than those
   caring for male survivors {[}44.4 +/- 8.3] (p = 0.03). There were no
   significant correlations between caregiver burden and age of the stroke
   survivor; however, a low correlation was found between depression and
   caregiver burden (r = -0.33, p = 0.02). Female survivors were found to
   have significantly higher levels of depression than males (16.72 +/-
   6.21 vs 11.34 +/- 7.31, p < 0.01) and caregivers of survivors who had
   higher depression scores experienced more burden.
   Conclusion: Preliminary findings point to depressive symptoms and
   functional status in the stroke survivor as being a significant
   contributor to caregiver burden; however, further data collection and
   analysis need to be completed before more definitive conclusions can be
   made.},

Title = {A Qualitative Study into Stroke Caregivers' Educational Needs -
   Perspectives of Caregivers and Healthcare Professionals},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF SINGAPORE HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {166-174},

Abstract = {Background: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) often provide information
   based on what they thought caregivers would need and like to know,
   rather than on the latter's perceived or actual needs. The current
   descriptive study was undertaken to find out more about HCP's and
   caregivers' perceptions of educational needs while the stroke survivor
   is still being cared for in an acute hospital.
   Methods: Ten caregivers, five nurses, and two neurologists were
   interviewed about their perceptions of educational needs during the
   stroke survivors' stay in acute care. All interviews were audiotaped,
   transcribed verbatim, and then analysed to identify main patterns of
   responses. The Framework Approach, which involves the steps of
   familiarisation, identifying a thematic framework, indexing, charting,
   mapping, and interpretation was used to inform the analysis.
   Results: Caregivers and HCPs agreed on the need for information on
   disease progression, prevention of recurrence, practical and emotional
   care. However, HCPs felt caregivers should also know about medication,
   which was not mentioned by any of the caregivers. Caregivers preferred
   ``hands-on experience{''} and ``hearing{''} from HCP to print materials.
   While some caregivers felt that their active involvement in caregiving
   training was not required if a foreign domestic worker (FDW) was to be
   hired, HCPs interviewed felt strongly that next-of-kin should,
   nonetheless, be trained as well.
   Conclusion: The expressed needs on stroke education did not differ
   greatly between caregivers and HCPs. Perhaps unique to the Singapore
   context, is the availability of FDWs to take on the care-giving role.
   HCPs should be aware of differences in expectations in the level of
   involvement of family members in the presence of a FDW.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the emotional response to
   caregiving among stroke caregivers and to assess the social and
   psychological impact of strokes on households two years after the event.
   Questionnaires were administered to 62 patient (64.4 years
   old)/caregiver (59.3 years old) dyads. The survey focused on: 1)
   residual impairments, based on the American Heart Association Stroke
   Outcome Classification; 2) the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA - 24
   items 5 dimensions); and 3) changes in the division of household tasks
   (seven items). Although male and female caregivers care for patients
   with similar residual impairments, the study found that female
   caregivers were more likely to be affected by the impact of caregiving
   on their health and schedule and by lack of family support. Women were
   more likely to feel ``tired all the time{''} (50\% vs. 12.5\%), to
   struggle to ``find time to relax{''} (35.7\% vs. 6.3\%) and to feel that
   ``others dumped caring onto them{''} (35.7\% vs. 11.8\%). Since the
   onset of stroke, women had also taken on more responsibilities in the
   household (37.5\% vs. 5.9\%), while men were more likely to ``enjoy
   caring{''} for patients (93.8\% vs. 67.9\%) and to have become more
   involved in organizing holidays (29\% vs. 5.6\%) and seeing friends
   (20.6\% vs. 10.5\%). Because of the high level of exhaustion,
   particularly among women, caregivers are a high-risk population for the
   healthcare system. Interventions such as trialogue and counseling are
   required to meet the needs of male and female caregivers.},

Title = {Internet Access and Usage Among Stroke Survivors and Their Informal
   Caregivers: Cross-sectional Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: Web-based interventions have shown promise for chronic
   disease management but have not been widely applied to populations with
   stroke. Existing barriers may inhibit the adoption of web-based
   interventions among stroke survivors and necessitate the involvement of
   informal caregivers. However, limited information is available on
   internet accessibility and usability among stroke survivors and their
   caregivers.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate internet access and usage in a
   cohort of stroke survivors and their caregivers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 375 participants
   (248 stroke survivors and 127 caregivers). Descriptive statistics were
   generated using cross-tabulation. Comparisons with categorical data were
   conducted using the chi-square test, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was
   used for comparisons involving ordinal variables.
   Results: Overall, 86.1\% (323/375) of the participants reported having
   internet access. Caregivers were more likely than stroke survivors to
   access the internet (N=375, chi(2)(1)=18.5, P<.001) and used text
   messaging (n=321, chi(2)(1)=14.7, P<.001). Stroke survivors and
   caregivers with internet access were younger than stroke survivors and
   caregivers without internet access. The highest number of participants
   who reported internet access were non-Hispanic White. Smartphones were
   the most common devices used to access the internet. Email was the most
   common type of internet usage reported. Patients who survived for >12
   months after a stroke reported higher internet access than those who
   survived <3 months (P<.001). The number of hours per week spent using
   the internet was higher for caregivers than for stroke survivors
   (P<.001).
   Conclusions: Future feasibility and acceptability studies should
   consider the role of the informal caregiver, participant age, race and
   ethnicity, the use of smartphone apps, email and text correspondence,
   and the amount of time elapsed since the stroke event in the design and
   implementation of web-based interventions for populations with stroke.},

Abstract = {Anxiety and depression are common mental illness in stroke caregivers,
   resulting in significant stress to the emotion health of caregivers.
   Caregivers' emotion can seriously affect the recovery rate of stroke
   patient, therefore, how to control and affect the caregivers' anxiety
   and depression is of great importance. Here three multiple centers
   observation and validation study were performed to screen out the risk
   factors for development of anxiety and depression in main family
   caregiver, and the effect of anxiety and depression of family caregivers
   on 6-month mortality of patients with moderate-severe stroke. The
   severity of the stroke, the duration of care time and the medical
   payment associated with increased risk of anxiety and depression.
   Anxiety and depression of main family caregivers are associated with
   increased risk 6-month mortality of patients with moderate-severe
   stroke. Therefore, the support provided to the family caregivers might
   have positive effect on prognosis of the patients with stroke.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of home-care nursing
   intervention on the burden of family caregivers for older adults
   surviving a stroke. A randomised clinical trial blinded for outcome
   evaluation. Forty-eight family caregivers of older adults surviving a
   stroke took part in the study. The intervention group (IG) received
   three home visits by nurses in 1 month after hospital discharge for
   guidance on the disease and care activities for the elderly people. The
   control group (CG) relied on the service network that had access. The
   Caregiver Burden Scale was applied to assess the burden outcome 1 week,
   60 days and 1 year after hospital discharge. The caregivers of the
   intervention and CGs had no difference regarding baseline data. There
   was an interaction effect between the CG and the IG in the isolation
   domain (p = 0.037) and in the emotional involvement domain (p = 0.003)
   over time. These findings provide support for strengthening a care line
   for the elderly people after a stroke, with adequate discharge planning,
   indicating the importance of integrating care network services such as
   primary care, home care and hospital care with a view to achieving an
   effective care transition. It is also necessary to construct a specific
   instrument to evaluate other outcomes, such as the knowledge and
   learning of caregivers in relation to the care activities taught. This
   study is registered in the Clinical Trials with nameNursing Home Care
   Intervention Post Stroke(SHARE) and under number NCT02807012.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke results in significant caregiver burden and strain.
   Objective: The main objectives of this study is to assess the burden and
   its consequences in caregivers of stroke patients and to determine the
   associated factors to caregivers' burden. Methods: A cross-sectional
   study was conducted over 1 year on 70 consecutive patients who attended
   the Shree Krishna Hospital, Karamsad stroke clinic. Demographic and
   clinical characteristics of all patients were recorded after obtaining
   the consent. The modified rankin scale and Barthel index were
   administered to the patient, whereas Caregiver strain index, Caregiver
   burden scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety
   Disorder-7, and Kuppuswami scale were administered to the patient's
   caregiver. Descriptive statistics were used to portray demographic and
   clinical profiles. Correlation coefficients were used to assess the
   association between different scales, and t-test was applied to assess
   association of caregivers' burden with different categorical variables.
   Results: The mean age was 60 years for patients and 47 years for
   caregivers. Nearly 72.8\% of patients were male, whereas 57\% of
   caregivers were female. The mean caregiver burden scale score was 28.26.
   Caregivers' burden decreased with increase in stroke duration (P =
   0.01), increase in education level (P = 0.054), and upper socioeconomic
   status (P = 0.02). Caregivers' burden increased with caring for male
   gender (P = 0.18), being a female caregiver (P = 0.31), longer caregiver
   hours (r = 0.51), and increased patient disability (P < 0.01). A strong
   correlation existed between caregivers' burden and depression (0.72);
   anxiety and depression (0.84); caregivers' burden and caregiver strain
   index (0.72). Conclusions: A structured and targeted caregiver
   intervention is urgently needed to relieve caregivers' burden and
   related psychological comorbidities in an Indian setup.},

Title = {Benefits finding among Chinese family caregivers of stroke survivors: a
   qualitative descriptive study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Abstract = {Objectives The caregiving experience includes both caregiver burdens and
   benefits finding. However, the benefits obtained by family caregivers of
   stroke survivors in Chinese community dwellings are unknown. The
   objective of this study was to explore the benefits experienced by
   family caregivers of stroke survivors in Chinese community dwellings.
   Design A qualitative descriptive design was used, fulfilling the
   consolidated criteria for the Standards for Reporting Qualitative
   Research reporting guidelines. Semi-structured interviews were conducted
   with 20 family caregivers of stroke survivors. The interviews were
   audiotaped, transcribed and analysed. Thematic analysis was performed to
   analyse the interview transcripts.
   Setting and participants Home interviews were conducted with family
   caregivers of stroke survivors in two communities in Zhengzhou, China.
   Results The family caregivers of stroke survivors experienced various
   benefits from caregiving. There were both internal benefits (increases
   in knowledge and skills, the development of positive attitudes, and the
   development of a sense of worthiness and achievement) and external
   benefits (family growth and gains in social support), which interact to
   create a healthy lifestyle.
   Conclusion Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective in
   understanding the benefits perceived by family caregivers of stroke
   survivors. This study provides insights into interventions focused on
   identifying benefits finding in six domains that may help reduce
   negative emotions and promote the mental health of caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose The aim of the study was to identify areas of caregiver
   engagement in stroke care as viewed by stroke survivors and family
   caregivers. Design Interviews with stroke survivor/caregiver dyads (N =
   71) from a population-based study of incident stroke. Methods We
   interviewed stroke survivors and caregivers about caregiver involvement
   at multiple stages of stroke care. We assessed similarities and
   differences between stroke survivor and caregiver reports and analyzed
   responses to open-ended questions. Findings Stroke survivor and
   caregiver reports of engagement were highly correlated (r = .89),
   although caregivers reported higher involvement. Open-ended comments
   suggested that, in about 25\% of cases, stroke survivors and caregivers
   agreed that caregiver engagement led to major improvements in stroke
   survivor care, most commonly during onset of symptoms. Conclusions
   Stroke survivors and caregivers report significant and impactful
   caregiver engagement throughout the course of stroke.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Family caregivers provide essential support to individuals
   recovering after experiencing a stroke. Although clinical guidelines
   recommend the provision of caregiver education and support, these
   guidelines have not been implemented into standard clinical practice.
   The objective of this study was to gain insight from key
   informants-affiliates of a regional stroke system-to identify
   organization and system level barriers and facilitators associated with
   implementing stroke caregiver programs. Methods: Twelve key informants
   were interviewed. Informants discussed their experiences with and
   perceptions of caregiver programs. They also identified barriers and
   facilitators to implementing caregiver programs. Interview data were
   analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were
   generated: (1) lack of consensus on the need for caregiver education and
   support programs as part of the health care system; (2) a collaborative
   process is needed to engage stakeholders and identify champions (3)
   stakeholders need different types of evidence in support of
   implementation. Conclusions: This study provides initial insight into
   the potential barriers and facilitators needed to develop and implement
   stroke caregiver programs. Further exploration of these topics can
   inform caregiver program development and their implementation into
   stroke systems of care.},

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the concomitant effects of two
   patient-directed interventions for post-stroke depressive symptoms on
   caregivers' well-being. Design: Secondary analyses of the results of a
   randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Fifty caregivers of stroke
   patients receiving outpatient rehabilitation. Interventions: Stroke
   patients and their caregivers were randomly allocated to either
   cognitive-behavioural therapy augmented with movement or occupational
   therapy (n = 23) or computerized cognitive training (n = 27) to
   alleviate depressive symptoms in patients. Main measures: Emotional
   burden (Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire), practical burden
   (Caregiver Strain Index), mental health (General Health Questionnaire)
   and emotional complaints (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).
   Results: Caregivers of patients who received cognitive-behavioural
   therapy reported significantly higher mental health levels (mean
   difference (MD) = 1.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.43-3.13, P =
   0.01) and less worrying about patients' well-being (MD = 1.9, 95\% CI =
   0.56-3.24, P < 0.01). In addition, there were positive time effects on
   the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire for Brain Injury, particularly
   the subscales Worrying, Supervision and Tension. Conclusion: The results
   suggest that augmented cognitive-behavioural therapy aimed at improving
   patients' emotional, behavioural and social functioning positively
   affects some aspects of caregivers' well-being.},

Title = {Relationship Consensus and Caregiver Burden in Adults with Cognitive
   Impairments 6 Months Following Stroke},
Journal = {PM\&R},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Pages = {597-603},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden is commonly experienced in caregivers of
   adults with cognitive impairment after stroke. This burden can be
   associated with caregiver-centered factors, including
   caregiver-perceived relationship quality.
   Objective: To examine the role of caregiver-perceived relationship
   quality on caregiver burden at 6 months following stroke.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: Community settings.
   Participants: Adults enrolled in two randomized controlled trials after
   stroke (n = 60) and their caregivers (n = 60).
   Methods: Three constructs of relationship quality (relationship
   consensus, cohesion, and satisfaction) were examined as predictors of
   caregiver burden (the Abbreviated Dyadic Adjustment Scale). A
   hierarchical logistic regression and a Poisson regression with robust
   standard errors were used to examine the effect of relationship quality
   on caregiver burden while controlling for characteristics of stroke
   survivors and caregivers.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Caregiver burden was measured with the
   abridged version of the Zarit Burden Interview.
   Results: Poor relationship consensus (odds ratio {[}OR] = 1.48; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.06-2.07; P = .02) increased the odds of
   high caregiver burden after controlling for characteristics of stroke
   survivors (age, comorbidity, cognitive fluency) and caregivers (gender,
   self-reported health). Relationship cohesion (OR = 1.03; 95\% CI =
   .84-1.25; P = .81) and relationship satisfaction (OR = 1.53; 95\% CI =
   .75-3.10; P = .24) did not predict caregiver burden.
   Conclusion: Meaningful and agreeable goals and expectations between
   dyads are essential to reduce caregiver burden after stroke.
   Collaborative goal-setting between stroke survivors and their caregivers
   may be a promising intervention strategy to increase relationship
   consensus and reduce caregiver burden.},

Abstract = {Background: Informal caregivers of post-stroke patients usually undergo
   high levels of pain and stress and have a reduced quality of life.
   Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of two home ergonomic
   interventions aimed at reducing pain intensity and perceived stress and
   enhancing the quality of life in informal caregivers of chronic
   post-stroke patients.
   Methods: A randomized single-blind controlled clinical trial was
   conducted, with a sample of 33 informal caregivers of patients with
   stroke. Three groups were included: one received postural hygiene
   training and kinesiotherapy, for 12 weeks, two days a week, one hour per
   session; another received adaptation of the home environment, and the
   third was a control group. Pain intensity, stress level and general
   quality of life were evaluated at three-time points: pre-intervention,
   post-intervention, and after a follow-up period of three months.
   Results: Neck pain decreased in the two experimental groups, and
   increased in the control group. Pain in the shoulders and knees was
   alleviated in the group that received postural hygiene and
   kinesiotherapy. In addition, regarding quality of life, this group
   obtained an improvement in the physical health dimension, while the home
   adaptation group reported improved social relationships.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that 12 weeks of training in postural
   hygiene, combined with kinesiotherapy, and home adaptations can reduce
   pain and improve several aspects of the quality of life of this
   population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background/Aims: In stroke rehabilitation, the goal is to discharge
   patients at their optimal functional level, however, this level of
   independence is not always reached at discharge due to decreased length
   of stay and a high demand for beds. Thus, patients rely upon caregivers
   to assist them not only with activities of daily living but also with
   home exercise programmes. The purpose of this study was to establish
   caregivers' perceived enablers and barriers of adherence to home
   exercise programmes in stroke survivors.
   Methods: A qualitative study design was used with in-depth interviews of
   the caregivers of stroke survivors who were dependent in functional
   activities.
   Findings: The average age of the caregivers was 47.8 years (+/- 13.96)
   years and all of them were the stroke survivors' family members. The
   most common enablers of adherence to home exercise programmes were self
   -motivation, external motivation from friends and family, having a daily
   routine, spirituality, caregivers' attitude and desires, and caregiver
   knowledge. The most common barriers of adherence to home exercise
   programmes were general health issues, caregiver having other
   responsibilities, lack of family and social support, caregiver burden
   and stress, low self-efficacy and mood, and fear of falling.
   Conclusions: Adherence to home exercise programmes is multifactorial and
   does not only relate to the stroke survivor alone. Caregivers have a lot
   of responsibilities and experience emotional strain and burden. This has
   an influence on stroke survivors' adherence to home exercise programmes
   as they rely upon caregivers for assistance.},

Title = {Is self or caregiver report comparable to Medicare claims indicators of
   healthcare utilization after stroke?},
Journal = {TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {521-526},
Abstract = {Background: Claims data from Medicare or other payers might not
   generalize to other populations regarding service use after stroke
   especially among younger patients. However, high agreement between
   self-report and Medicare claims data would support the use of
   self-reported healthcare utilization data in these populations.
   Methods: A population-based sample of 147 stroke participants with
   traditional fee-for service Medicare and their family caregivers was
   examined. Concordance with Medicare claims was examined for stroke
   participant self-report for Emergency Room visits, hospitalizations, and
   physician visits for a six-month period after stroke, and for both
   stroke participant and caregiver reports of receipt of Physical Therapy
   (PT), Speech and Language Pathology (SLP), or Home Health Agency (HHA)
   visits.
   Results: Agreement was good for Emergency Room visits (kappa 0.75),
   hospitalization (kappa 0.70), and physician visits (Prevalence Adjusted
   Bias Adjusted Kappa {[}PABAK] 0.69) but more moderate for physical
   therapy, speech and language therapy, and home health agency visits
   (kappa 0.56-0.63). Caregiver agreement with Medicare claims was similar
   to stroke participant agreement. African Americans were less likely to
   self-report therapy compared to whites (OR 0.32 PT, 0.38 SLP, 0.29 HHA,
   p < 0.03). Younger stroke participants reported lower levels of
   Emergency Room visits than claims (OR 0.81, p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Healthcare utilization after stroke can be reliably assessed
   from Medicare claims, Stroke participant, or Caregiver report for
   salient events such as hospitalizations and Emergency Room visits.
   Self-report and caregiver report appear to be less reliable for
   identifying use of therapy or home health services. Caution should be
   used when interpreting disparities based on self-report data alone in
   these areas.},

Abstract = {Background: Prevalence of stroke and traditional filial responsibility
   involve adult children in caregiving to their parent stroke survivors in
   China. Support resources are insufficient because of the shrinking size
   of family and the underdeveloped support system.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the correlates of
   perceived social support among adult child caregivers of parent stroke
   survivors in China.
   Methods: A cross-sectional correlational design was used in this study.
   A nonproportional quota sample of 126 adult child caregivers was
   recruited from Zhejiang Province, China. Data were collected at either
   the hospital stroke units or the respondents' homes using structured
   questionnaires of caregiving dyadic demographics and caregiving
   characteristics, 14-item Activities of Daily Living, 15-item Mutuality
   Scale, and 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.
   SPSS 17.0was used for analysis.
   Results: Caregivers' mutuality, education, full employment or being
   retired, monthly income, having a co-carer, and having a father as the
   care receiver were significantly positively associatedwith caregivers'
   perceived social support. However, mutuality was not significantly
   associated with caregivers' perceived social support after the other
   factors were adjusted.
   Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Adult child caregivers with
   higher levels of mutuality, education, or monthly income; who are fully
   employed or are retired; who have a cocarer; or who are caring for a
   father perceived more social support. Nursing strategies and social
   policies need to be directed to enhance caregiver mutuality and support
   caregiving efforts.},

Abstract = {Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a neurologic condition that can happen
   after a patient has had some kind of neurological insult. In this
   syndrome, involuntary, uncontrollable, and inappropriate emotional
   outbursts unrelated or out of proportion to the situation are common
   symptoms. This can be very frustrating and scary. Because stroke
   survivors and their caregivers are overloaded with information during
   the transition from hospital to home, information about PBA is not
   usually discussed. In a survey by the National Stroke Association, 53\%
   of stroke survivors reported that they had some of the symptoms of this
   disorder. Even if they discussed these symptoms with their health care
   providers, less than half were given a diagnosis, and less than a
   quarter received any kind of treatment. The purpose of this article is
   to give nurses more information about PBA so they can share this with
   patients and families/significant others and encourage them to seek help
   if they experience these symptoms once discharged. It is hoped that
   increased knowledge about this condition will lead to better diagnosis
   and treatment and increased quality of life for stroke survivors.},

Title = {Burden and Cognitive Appraisal of Stroke Survivors' Informal Caregivers:
   An Assessment of Depression Model With Mediating and Moderating Effects},

Abstract = {This study proposes and evaluates a model of depression that concerns
   the role of burden and cognitive appraisal as mediators or moderators of
   outcomes among stroke survivor caregivers. A total of 105 informal
   caregivers of stroke survivor completed the self-report measures of
   Caregiver Burden Inventory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
   Scale, and Cognitive Impact of Appraisal Scale. The Glasgow Coma Scale
   and Barthel Index were used by the researcher to examine the physical
   functional status of the survivor. Partial least squares (PIS) path
   modeling was used to estimate the parameters of a depression model that
   included mediating or moderating effects. The model shows that burden
   and impact of cognitive appraisal have a significant direct and indirect
   impact on depression, while survivor physical functional status does not
   have a direct impact. The model also demonstrates that burden and impact
   of cognitive appraisal separately play a mediating role between survivor
   physical functional status and caregiver depression. In addition,
   cognitive appraisal has a moderating influence on the relationship
   between burden and depression. Overall, survivor physical functional
   status, burden, and cognitive appraisal were the predictors of caregiver
   depression, explaining 47.1\% of the variance. This study has shown that
   burden and cognitive appraisal are mediators that more fully explain the
   relationship between patient severity and caregiver depression. (C) 2015

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of
   support group intervention on family system strengths of rural
   caregivers of stroke patients.
   DesignTrue experimental pretest and post-test design was adopted for the
   study.
   SettingThe study was conducted in Kattankulathur Block, a rural area in
   Kancheepuram district, India.
   ParticipantsTwo hundred forty caregivers of stroke patients were
   selected by simple random sampling technique.
   InterventionEnrolment in self-help groups and attending meetings were
   used as the interventional strategy for the purpose of this study.
   Main outcome measureThe main outcome of the study was to evaluate the
   impact of support group intervention on family system strengths of rural
   caregivers of stroke patients.
   ResultsFollowing intervention, the mean score and the standard deviation
   of the experimental group increased to 44.73 and 5.83, respectively, the
   control group mean score remained at 22.08 and the standard deviation
   was 3.07 at t=37.58. P value was 0.001, which is statistically
   significant at the confidence interval of 39.45\%.
   ConclusionIt was found that there was a significant and positive
   increase in the family system strengths of caregivers who participated
   in the self-help group meetings, thereby suggesting that support group
   intervention programs are an effective nursing strategy that can be
   employed for improving the overall well-being of the caregivers of
   stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Among stroke consequences highlights the negative impact
   on the informal carers' health related quality of life (HRQoL).
   Objectives: To identify HRQoL dimensions most greatly affected in stroke
   caregivers and stablish relations with dependent variables of survivors
   and caregivers.
   Methods: Transversal study of 215 informal caregivers of stroke
   survivors (1:3 man/woman, mean age 63.6 (+/- 11.03) years). Main outcome
   measure was health perception assessed with the Short Fom 36 (SF-36).
   Clinical and demographic data of stroke patients were also registered.
   Statistical tests used were Chi-square, t-Student test and Spearman
   correlation coefficient.
   Results: Vitality and general health were the most affected dimensions
   perceived by caregivers. In comparaison with the Spanish general
   population, female caregivers aged 45-54 years presented a significant
   reduction in the SF-36 subscales of vitality (p=0.003), social function
   (p=0.01), emotional role (p=0.038) and mental health (p=0.002). Female
   caregivers aged 55-64 years also showed a significant reduction in
   social function (p=0.027) and emotional role (p=0.024). Male caregivers
   did not present significant lower HRQoL.
   Conclusions: Caregiving experience has a negative impact on HRQoL,
   specially middleaged female caregivers. Some carer physical and
   psychological characteristics (depression, musculoskeletal pain, time
   spent on caring) and survivor disability shown to influence carers
   outcomes. Caregivers play an important role in the recovery of stroke
   patients, so that the identification of strategies which help them to
   cope with the stroke might avoid that the role of caring results in a
   loss of quality of life. (C) 2009 SECA. Published by Elsevier Espana,

Title = {Depressive Symptom Trajectories in Family Caregivers of Stroke Survivors
   During First Year of Caregiving},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Background
   The purpose of this study was to identify patterns of depressive symptom
   trajectory and examine the associations of the symptom trajectory with
   caregiving burden, family function, social support, and perceived health
   status of caregivers of stroke survivors during the first year of
   caregiving after discharge from rehabilitation center. Methods
   Caregivers of stroke survivors completed a survey of depressive
   symptoms, caregiving burden, family function, perceived availability of
   social support, and perceived health status at postdischarge and 1 year.
   Patterns of depressive symptom trajectory (ie, symptom-free, symptom
   relieved, symptom developed, and persistent symptom groups) were
   identified by grouping depressive symptoms based on 2 assessments using
   the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression. Repeated-measures
   analysis of variance and multinomial logistic regression were used to
   examine the associations. Results
   Of the 102 caregivers, 57.8\% were symptom-free, 20.6\% experienced
   persistent depressive symptoms, 11.8\% relieved depressive symptoms, and
   9.8\% developed depressive symptoms. There were significant changes in
   family function (Wilks lambda = 0.914, P = .038) and perceived health
   status (Wilks lambda = 0.914, P = .033) among the groups during the
   first year of caregiving. The persistent symptom group reported the
   highest level of burden and the lowest level of family function and
   perceived availability of social support at both assessment times.
   Compared with symptom-free caregivers, caregivers with persistent
   depressive symptoms were 7 times more likely to have fair/poor health
   rather than excellent/very good health at 1 year (odds ratio, 7.149; P =
   .012). Conclusion
   Caregivers with persistent depressive symptoms are the most vulnerable
   to negative psychosocial outcomes and poor perceived health status
   during the first year of caregiving from discharge for stroke survivors.},

Title = {Moderator Role of Mutuality on the Association Between Depression and

Abstract = {Background
   Authors of previous research have not yet analyzed the role of potential
   moderators in the relationship between depressive symptoms and quality
   of life (QOL). Aims
   The aim of this study was to examine the moderating effect of mutuality
   between depressive symptoms and QOL in stroke survivor and caregiver
   dyads. Methods
   This study used a longitudinal design with 222 stroke survivor-caregiver
   dyads enrolled at survivor discharge from rehabilitation hospitals. Data
   collection was performed for 12 months. We examined survivor and
   caregiver QOL dimensions (physical, psychological, social, and
   environmental), depression, and mutuality at baseline and every 3
   months. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test 4 longitudinal
   dyadic moderation models (1 for each QOL domain). Results
   Survivors (50\% male) and caregivers (65\% female) were 70.8 (SD, 11.9)
   and 52.5 (SD, 13.1) years old, respectively. We observed no significant
   moderating effects of mutuality for survivors across the 4 dimensions of
   QOL over time. However, higher survivor mutuality was significantly
   associated with higher survivor psychological and social QOL at
   baseline. Regarding caregivers, caregiver mutuality significantly
   moderated the association between caregiver depressive symptoms and
   caregiver physical (B = 0.63, P < .05), psychological (B = 0.63, P <
   .01), and social (B = 0.95, P < .001) QOL at baseline, but not in
   environmental QOL. Higher caregiver mutuality was significantly
   associated with less improvement in caregiver physical QOL over time.
   Conclusions
   Mutuality is a positive variable on the association between depression
   and QOL for both members of the dyad at discharge but may lead to
   declines in physical health for caregivers over time. Further work is
   needed to understand the role of mutuality on long-term outcomes and
   associations with increased care strain.},

Abstract = {Purpose:To record the health promotion behaviors of family caregivers of
   stroke survivors, as well as potential determinants that could affect
   these behaviors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out
   through home visits in the Attica region using the convenience sampling
   method. The studied population included 109 survivors who had suffered a
   stroke and experienced functional problems, and their 109 primary
   caregivers, who were family members, lived in the same house and were
   fully responsible for their care. The dependent variables were the
   caregivers' health promotion behaviors, while the independent variables
   were the survivors and caregivers' demographic characteristics,
   survivors' functional capacity, depression, social support and changes
   in caregivers' lives from caring. Results: Better health promotional
   behaviors were associated with the following: patient having advanced
   age and a high level of functionality, caregivers assessing their own
   state of health as ``good{''}, greater social support, a higher
   educational level and a higher income level. In addition, more hours of
   patient care were associated with a less healthy lifestyle for
   caregivers. Conclusions: Promoting the health of family caregivers of
   stroke survivors is crucial for both survivors and caregivers. For this
   reason, it is of great importance to detect factors that affect the
   health promotion behaviors of caregivers in order to carry out
   appropriate interventions and improve their quality of life.},

Abstract = {Despite a focus on physical and cognitive outcomes, stroke survivors are
   also impacted by emotional and mental health challenges. Additionally,
   their caregivers may experience decreased well-being due to increased
   burden and role adjustment. A small body of literature characterizes
   this experience as a form of grief and loss. This study seeks to explore
   experiences of grief and loss reported by stroke survivors and
   caregivers, using Holbrook's 4-stage bereavement model. This
   cross-sectional, qualitative study was conducted among adult stroke
   survivors (n = 9) and their spousal caregivers (n = 5). Focus groups on
   experiences of recent hospitalizations and transitions home were
   transcribed, coded, and thematic analysis was conducted, identifying a
   major theme of loss. Data were reanalyzed guided by Holbrook's model.
   Common themes were losses and changes experienced by
   patients/caregivers, disbelief, and lack of understanding. Subthemes of
   denial and confusion were present. Less prevalent themes were loss of
   existing support systems and silver lining. Stroke survivors and
   caregivers experienced a range of negative emotions, impacting
   behaviors, self-perception, roles, and social support. Awareness of
   these issues can improve practice with those affected by stroke.},

Title = {Feasibility of ActivABLES to promote home-based exercise and physical
   activity of community-dwelling stroke survivors with support from
   caregivers: A mixed methods study},

Abstract = {BackgroundTechnical applications can promote home-based exercise and
   physical activity of community-dwelling stroke survivors. Caregivers are
   often able and willing to assist with home-based exercise and physical
   activity but lack the knowledge and resources to do so. ActivABLES was
   established to promote home-based exercise and physical activity among
   community-dwelling stroke survivors, with support from their caregivers.
   The aim of our study is to investigate the feasibility of ActivABLES in
   terms of acceptability, demand, implementation and practicality.MethodsA
   convergent design of mixed methods research in which quantitative
   results were combined with personal experiences of a four-week use of
   ActivABLES by community-dwelling stroke survivors with support from
   their caregivers. Data collection before, during and after the four-week
   period included the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Activities-Specific
   Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) and Five Times Sit
   to Stand Test (5xSST) and data from motion detectors. Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with stroke survivors and caregivers after the
   four-week period. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative
   data. Qualitative data was analysed with direct content analysis. Themes
   were identified related to the domains of feasibility: acceptability,
   demand, implementation and practicality. Data was integrated by
   examining any (dis)congruence in the quantitative and qualitative
   findings.ResultsTen stroke survivors aged 55-79years participated with
   their informal caregivers. Functional improvements were shown in BBS
   (+2.5), ABC (+0.9), TUG (-4.2) and 5xSST (-2.7). More physical activity
   was detected with motion detectors (stand up/sit down +2, number of
   steps +227, standing +0.3h, hours sitting/lying -0.3h). The qualitative
   interviews identified themes for each feasibility domain: (i)
   acceptability: appreciation, functional improvements, self-initiated
   activities and expressed potential for future stroke survivors; (2)
   demand: reported use, interest in further use and need for follow-up;
   (3) implementation: importance of feedback, variety of exercises and
   progression of exercises and (4) practicality: need for support and
   technical problems. The quantitative and qualitative findings converged
   well with each other and supported the feasibility of
   ActivABLES.ConclusionsActivABLES is feasible and can be a good asset for
   stroke survivors with slight or moderate disability to use in their
   homes. Further studies are needed with larger samples.},

Abstract = {Objectives To verify the effectiveness and feasibility of a nine-week
   benefit-finding intervention on the burden, quality of life, and benefit
   finding of caregivers, as well as on the quality of life of stroke
   survivors. Methods Benefit finding refers to the individual, social,
   psychological and spiritual benefits perceived by an individual
   experiencing stress or post-traumatic events. A randomized controlled
   trial was performed in which 68 stroke survivors and their caregivers
   were recruited from the Zhengzhou community, China, and randomly split
   into two groups. The intervention group included those having undergone
   a nine-week benefit-finding intervention, while the control group
   included those individuals having undergone a nine-week routine health
   education. At baseline and one-week post-intervention (after a 9-week
   intervention), the quality of life of stroke survivors and caregivers
   and the burden and benefit finding of caregivers were determined.
   Results In comparison to the control group, caregiver benefit finding,
   quality of life, burden, and stroke survivor quality of life were
   significantly improved (P<.005). Conclusions The intervention appears to
   be feasible for stroke patients and caregivers. The intervention is
   capable of improving the quality of life of caregivers and survivors,
   increasing the benefit finding of caregivers and reducing the burden of
   caregivers. Clinical Implications The benefit-finding intervention is
   capable of improving the health condition of stroke patients and
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to design a mobile-friendly,
   Internet-based website, modeled on previously described websites for
   Alzheimer caregivers, to equip stroke caregivers and potentially reduce
   caregiver burden.
   Design A mixed-methods study was performed to design and test the
   usability of the Stroke Caregiver Support System (SCSS).
   Methods An iterative, user-centered design approach was employed in
   three phases: (I) Focus Groups, (II) Structured Interviews, and (III)
   Usability Testing. Phase I and Phase II provided information for the
   development of the SCSS website, whereas Phase III helped in gathering
   data regarding the usability and efficacy of the newly implemented SCSS
   website.
   Findings Qualitative data on caregiving and the content and design of
   the SCSS were obtained from focus groups and interviews. In the
   usability test, the nine caregivers who completed Phase III (78\% women,
   mean age = 46, SD = 17) exhibited a high level of burden and depressive
   symptoms (median {[}Q1, Q3] Zarit burden score = 18 {[}16, 23], Center
   of Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale = 15 {[}8, 17]). Caregivers
   conveyed the usability of the SCSS but also expressed several needed
   improvements.
   Conclusions Participants reported the value of the SCSS, but further
   refinements are needed to maximize its usability and potential efficacy.
   Clinical Relevance The SCSS has potential to reduce caregiver burden in
   stroke.},

Title = {Caregiving Self-efficacy and Knowledge Regarding Patient Positioning
   Among Malaysian Caregivers of Stroke Patients},
Journal = {CUREUS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background
   Most family caregivers of stroke patients in Malaysia do not receive
   adequate prior preparation or training. This study aimed to determine
   levels of patient positioning knowledge and caregiving self-efficacy
   among caregivers of stroke patients.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted at an urban teaching hospital
   involving 128 caregivers of stroke patients. The caregivers were
   conveniently sampled and completed the data collection forms, which
   comprised their socio-demographic data, patients' functional status, the
   Caregiving Knowledge For Stroke Questionnaire: Patient Positioning
   (CKQ-My(C) Patient Positioning) to measure caregiver's knowledge on
   patient positioning, and the Family Caregiver Activation Tool (FCAT(C))
   to measure caregivers' self-efficacy in managing the patient.
   Descriptive and multivariate inferential statistics were used for data
   analysis.
   Results
   Among the caregivers sampled, 87.3\% had poor knowledge of positioning
   (mean score 14.9 +/- 4.32). The mean score for FCAT was 49.7 +/- 6.0
   from a scale of 10 to 60. There was no significant association between
   knowledge on positioning and self-efficacy. Multiple linear regression
   showed that caregivers' age (B = 0.146, p = 0.003) and caregiver
   training (B = 3.302, p = 0.007) were independently associated with
   caregivers' self-efficacy.
   Conclusion
   Caregivers' knowledge on the positioning of stroke patients was poor,
   despite a fairly good level of self-efficacy. Older caregivers and
   receiving caregiver training were independently associated with better
   caregiver self-efficacy. This supports the provision of caregiver
   training to improve caregiver self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {Objective: Despite the increasing availability of eRehabilitation, its
   use remains limited. The aim of this study was to assess factors
   associated with willingness to use eRehabilitation.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Subjects: Stroke patients, informal caregivers, health-care
   professionals.
   Methods: The survey included personal characteristics, willingness to
   use eRehabilitation (yes/no) and barriers/facilitators influencing this
   willingness (4-point scale). Barriers/facilitators were merged into
   factors. The association between these factors and willingness to use
   eRehabilitation was assessed using logistic regression analyses.
   Results: Overall, 125 patients, 43 informal caregivers and 105
   healthcare professionals participated in the study. Willingness to use
   eRehabilitation was positively influenced by perceived patient benefits
   (e.g. reduced travel time, increased motivation, better outcomes), among
   patients (odds ratio (OR) 2.68; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)
   1.34-5.33), informal caregivers (OR 8.98; 95\% CI 1.70-47.33) and
   healthcare professionals (OR 6.25; 95\% CI 1.17-10.48). Insufficient
   knowledge decreased willingness to use eRehabilitation among patients
   (OR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.17-0.74). Limitations of the study include low
   response rates and possible response bias.
   Conclusion: Differences were found between patients/informal caregivers
   and healthcare professionals. However, for both groups, perceived
   benefits of the use of eRehabilitation facilitated willingness to use
   eRehabilitation. Further research is needed to determine the benefits of
   such programs, and inform all users about the potential benefits, and
   how to use eRehabilitation.},

Abstract = {Background Stakeholders are important contributors in the implementation
   of a complex public health intervention. During the development phase of
   an implementation, alongside careful design of its components and
   investing in the exploration of the dynamic multi-stakeholder stroke
   rehabilitation setting, it is essential to assess possible
   implementation risks. Systematic stakeholder and risk analyses can guide
   the exploration process and enable teams involved in complex
   interventions to develop context-tailored implementation management
   instruments. Purpose To develop instruments that facilitate the
   implementation of the complex stroke caregiver intervention project in
   the real-life support system. Methods Systematic stakeholder and risk
   analyses were conducted composing five activities. Project stakeholders
   were identified, classified and assessed using a top-down approach,
   while implementation risks were identified and assessed by applying a
   bottom-up approach. Data were collected through interviews and focus
   groups. Results Based on the knowledge provided by the stakeholders, two
   context-tailored implementation management instruments were designed
   with a top-down approach: (1) a comprehensive `stakeholder-risk atlas'
   providing individual stakeholder information, such as role, access,
   contribution, power and interest, expectations, perceived risks and
   specific engagement activities and (2) an overall `project
   implementation strategy' concentrating on communication, transparency,
   network building and professionalism. Conclusion Complex interventions
   will benefit from early and comprehensive stakeholder and risk analyses.
   The early involvement of stakeholders, with their insightful knowledge,
   enables the research team to develop context-tailored implementation
   management instruments. Instruments will support the team during
   implementation and may impact positively on the outcome of the
   intervention. Knowledge can be obtained by combining top-down and
   bottom-up working approaches.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: Stroke is a major cause of disability and
   affects the lives of both the patients and their caregivers. The purpose
   of the study was to determine the relationship between the functional
   status of stroke survivors and the care burden and quality of life of
   their informal caregivers. The relationship between selected
   socio-demographic variables and the caregivers' caregiving experiences,
   quality of life, and care burden also was investigated. Methods: This
   cross-sectional study consisted of 100 patients and informal caregivers
   dyads. The Patient and Caregiver Information Form was used to collect
   demographic data; the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Barthel
   Index (BI) were used to assess functional status; the Caregiver Burden
   Scale (CBS) and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Quality of Life Scale
   (SF36-QLS) were used to assess the caregivers' burden and quality of
   life. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics,
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and parametric and non-parametric tests.
   Results: The mean FIM and BI scores of the patients were 61.0 +/- 30.0
   and 42.6 +/- 28.3, respectively. The caregivers' average score in the
   SF36-QLS subscale of general health perception was 51.7 +/- 22.7; their
   average CBS score was 39.2 +/- 13.8. The caregivers' quality of life was
   found to be moderate to high in the domains of physical function, social
   function, mental health, bodily pain, and general health, but low in the
   domains of physical role function, emotional role function, and
   vitality. There was a negative correlation between the average FIM and
   BI scores of stroke survivors and their caregivers' CBS scores or scores
   on the SF36-QLS subscale of general health perception. Conclusion: There
   is a relationship between the stroke survivors' functional status and
   their caregivers' burden and quality of life. The caregivers' quality of
   life decreased and their care burden increased as the functional status
   of the patients deteriorated.},

Abstract = {Although cigarette smoking is a major contributor to continued health
   problems after stroke, the majority of stroke survivors do not quit
   smoking. This may be due in part to the high rate of smoking among
   committed partners of stroke survivors. This study investigated the
   experiences of 11 dual-smoker stroke survivor-caregiver dyads,
   identifying themes which may be useful for understanding this entrenched
   population: managing the addiction as a dyad; conflicting feelings about
   whether smoking is an individual versus mutual concern; and dyad-level
   barriers and facilitators of quitting. We also present specific
   cessation strategies that dual-smoker dyads participating in the study
   described.},

Title = {Differences in Fracture Incidence According to Caregiver Type in Stroke
   Survivors},

Abstract = {Background: To assess whether the type of primary caregiver is a risk
   factor of the incidence of fracture among older adults who have survived
   a stroke. Methods: Data from 4282 stroke survivors in the National
   Health Insurance Service-Senior Cohort (2002-2013) were used in this
   study. We categorized type of primary caregiver as none, spouse/family
   caregiver, and formal caregiver. The incidence of fracture within the
   year postdischarge was used as the outcome variable. These data were
   subjected to a survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazard
   model. Results: Of the 4282 stroke survivors, 308 (7.2\%) experienced a
   fracture during the 1-year follow-up period. According to type of
   primary caregiver, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of fracture was lower
   among those whose caregiver was a spouse (HR = .68, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], .48-.96] and those with a formal caregiver (HR = .59,
   95\% CI, .36-.97) compared to stroke survivors with no caregiver. In
   particular, those with a family or formal caregiver who were being cared
   for in nursing facilities were less likely to be associated with
   fracture than those with no caregiver. Conclusions: The adjusted HR of
   fracture among stroke survivors was lower among those with primary
   caregivers compared to those without them. Thus, the government should
   monitor and allocate the appropriate attention to stroke survivors after
   discharge in order to ensure that they obtain the needed health care,
   especially for stroke survivors who are without a primary caregiver.},

Title = {Multimodal rehabilitation in the late phase after stroke enhances the
   life situation of informal caregivers},
Journal = {TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {161-167},
Abstract = {Purpose: The burden of caregiving for stroke survivors is well known,
   but the effect of late stroke rehabilitation on the life situation of
   informal caregivers is unknown. Here, we assessed changes in the life
   situation of informal caregivers of stroke survivors enrolled in a
   multimodal intervention trial.
   Methods: This controlled study was a questionnaire-based survey
   accompanying a three-armed randomized controlled trial of 123 stroke
   survivors. The care recipients of 106 caregivers who chose to
   participate were assigned to rhythm-and-music-based therapy (R-MT; n =
   37), horse-riding therapy (H-RT; n = 37), or delayed intervention
   (control group, n = 32). Perceived changes in the life situation of the
   caregivers were evaluated with the Life Situation among Spouses after
   the Stroke Event (LISS) questionnaire before randomization, after the
   12-week intervention, and 3 and 6 months later.
   Results: After the intervention, the change in the median LISS score was
   significantly higher among intervention caregivers (1.5 {[}interquartile
   range (IQR) 8.8]) than controls (1.5 {[}IQR 8.8] vs. 0.0 {[}IQR 12.0], p
   = 0.036). The improvement was maintained at 3 months (1.5 {[}IQR 9.0]
   vs. 0.0 {[}IQR 10.5], p = 0.039) but not at 6 months (p = 0.284).
   Conclusion: Engaging stroke survivors in multimodal interventions late
   after stroke appears to have potential to produce gains also in the
   general life situation of informal caregivers.},

Abstract = {The Adult Carer Quality of Life questionnaire (AC-QoL) is a reliable and
   valid instrument used to assess the quality of life (QoL) of adult
   family caregivers. We explored the psychometric properties and tested
   the reliability and validity of a Chinese version of the AC-QoL with
   reliability and validity testing in 409 Chinese stroke caregivers. We
   used item-total correlation and extreme group comparison to do item
   analysis. To evaluate its reliability, we used a test-retest reliability
   approach, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), together with
   Cronbach's alpha and model-based internal consistency index; to evaluate
   its validity, we used scale content validity, confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) via principal
   component analysis with varimax rotation. We found that the CFA did not
   in fact confirm the original factor model and our EFA yielded a 31-item
   measure with a five-factor model. In conclusions, although some items
   performed differently in our analysis of the original English language
   version and our Chinese language version, our translated AC-QoL is a
   reliable and valid tool which can be used to assess the quality of life
   of stroke caregivers in mainland China. Chinese version AC-QoL is a
   comprehensive and good measurement to understand caregivers and has the
   potential to be a screening tool to assess QoL of caregiver.},

Title = {Effects of Different Levels of Caregiver Training on Oral Hygiene After
   Stroke},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},

Pages = {1335-1340},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of caregiver training on
   poststroke oral hygiene and to identify appropriate structures for
   training programs. `
   DESIGN: Single-blind prospective cohort study.
   SETTING: Haikou, China,
   PARTICIPANTS: Individuals in home care who have had a stroke (N = 150)
   and their caregivers (N = 150). Eligibility criteria were stable
   condition, no recent use of antibiotics or periodontal therapy, presence
   of Ramfjord teeth or neighboring substitutes, and satisfactory Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment and Burke Water Swallow Test scores.
   INTERVENTION: Limited (LOHI) or comprehensive (COHI( oral hygiene
   instructions.
   MEASUREMENTS: Plaque Index (PI) and Gingival Index (GI) scores (ranging
   from 0 to 3 for both).
   RESULTS: Twenty care recipients and their caregivers dropped out during
   the study. In the care recipient groups, PT and GT scores in the COHI
   group were lower than in the control and LOHI groups at the end of the
   second and third month (P<.001). Decline in PI and GI scores in the COHI
   group started from the first month (P<.001). In the caregiver groups, GI
   and PI scores in the COHI group were lower than in the control and LOHI
   groups after baseline (P<.001). Decline in PI and Cl scores in the COHT
   group started from the second month (P<.001), although no group achieved
   clinically satisfactory levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed
   that care recipients' PI was correlated with caregivers' PI, number of
   sessions, and group allocation, as was care recipients' GI with
   caregivers' GI, number of sessions, and group allocation.
   CONCLUSION: Additional assessment of program components is necessary to
   produce clinically significant outcomes. Caregiver PI and GI scores may
   serve as objective measures of their oral hygiene skills, which can be
   improved with comprehensive instructions.},

Abstract = {Background: The similarities or differences of the threesome
   (physiotherapists, patients, and caregivers) thought about the process
   of stroke rehabilitation can play a key role in the success of
   rehabilitation.
   Objective: The aim of this qualitative study was to investigate the
   perspectives of the threesome, with regard to the two themes of the
   study: (1) What are the problems faced by the patients after stroke?;
   and (2) What does recovery after stroke mean to you?
   Methods: The qualitative questions and possible answers were prepared by
   four physiotherapists. The answers were matched to International
   Classification of Functioning (ICF) components. Seventy patients who
   were having treatment as in-patient rehabilitation centers, their
   caregivers, and physiotherapists were invited to the study. After the
   questions were asked and the possible response choices were presented,
   subjects were asked to prioritize these response choices.
   Results: One hundred and fifty-nine subjects, including 53 patients, 53
   caregivers, and 53 physiotherapists, were included to the study. When
   the theme 1 were examined, we found that the patients' first priority
   was functional abilities (ICF: body function and structure) such as
   using the hands and feet while the caregivers and physiotherapists
   prioritized self-care problems (ICF: activity and participation). The
   most common response to the theme 2 was ``being in same health condition
   before the disease'' (ICF: activity and participation) among the
   patients and caregivers and ``being able to move arm and leg on the
   affected side'' (body function and structure) among the
   physiotherapists.
   Conclusion: As a conclusion, problems faced by the patients, caregivers,
   and physiotherapists were perceived under the same ICF domain and that
   caregivers' and physiotherapists' priorities were the same.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Objective To investigate how much formal caregivers know about caring
   for stroke patients, and whether they adequately provide it.
   Methods Formal caregivers, who worked for stroke patients at 8 hospitals
   (including 4 university hospitals, 2 rehabilitation hospitals, and 2
   convalescent hospitals) participated in this study. The survey was based
   on a self-report questionnaire, with 6 categories containing a total of
   48 questions about the specific care of stroke patients: the demographic
   characteristics of the caregivers, bed positioning, the provision of
   meals, position changes and transfers, the range of motion exercises,
   and caregiver training.
   Results A total of 217 caregivers were surveyed, and they were
   distributed as follows: 41\% came from the university hospitals, 35\%
   came from the rehabilitation hospitals, and 24\% came from the
   convalescent hospitals. The percentages of correct answers were
   distributed as follows: 64.3\% for bed positioning, 74.3\% for providing
   meals, and 62.4\% for position change and transfer. The total and
   subscale scores of the caregivers working at convalescent hospitals were
   significantly lower than those of the caregivers working at the other
   types of hospitals (p<0.05). Only 7.8\% of the total participants
   received training on a regular basis. The caregivers obtained most of
   the information from caregiver associations (58.1\%), and the majority
   of the caregivers (65.4\%) were willing to receive training.
   Conclusion About one third (33.8\%) of caregivers did not have adequate
   knowledge of how to properly care for stroke patients; in fact, a
   significant number of caregivers demonstrated inappropriate and
   insufficient knowledge in several areas. It is assumed that the
   provision of regular training, by rehabilitation experts, will improve
   the professionalism and knowledge of the caregivers, and positively
   affect patient outcomes.},

Abstract = {Stroke is the first cause of disability in adults. Often, the care falls
   on the familyand can affect their quality of life.
   Aim: To determine the health-related quality of life and the level of
   caregiver burden of apatient after a stroke.
   Method: Descriptive and cross-sectional study. Caregivers, who had cared
   for a patient for morethan six months and without pay, were included.
   This study had been approved by the Ethics Committee.
   Variables collected: sociodemographic, EuroQol-5D questionnaire, Zarit
   scale, mood andsleep problems.
   Results: Forty- eight caregivers were included, with a mean age of 55.63
   (SD: 13.48) and themajority were women (70.8\%). The mean time of the
   care was 28.8 months (SD: 28.68), with 58\% stated having a depressed
   mood, 31\% had burden, and 89.6\% had sleep problems.
   The dimensions that presented problems (moderate and severe) in the
   EQ-5D were paindiscomfort (66.7\%) and anxiety- depression (68.8\%).
   The score on the visual analog scale rating of quality of life was
   associated with a worse mood( 75.5 vs. 32, p = 0.0028), with the pain
   (81.94 vs. 38, p < 0.001), and Zarit scale (r: < 0.334, p = 0.020).
   Conclusions: The role of caregivers of stroke patients often falls on
   women. To be a caregiveraffects the quality of life, mainly in the
   pain-discomfort and anxiety-depression dimensions, regardless of the
   functional status of the patient.
   Nurses must identify the psychopathological needs and develop strategies
   on the preventionof the risk of burnout. (C) 2014 Elsevier Espana,

Abstract = {Aims: To learn how occupational therapists (OTs), physical therapists
   (PTs), and speech language pathologists (SLPs) in the United States
   perceive their ability to address the needs of caregivers of stroke
   survivors and the factors that impact the provision of effective
   training. Methods: A quantitative exploratory survey method was used.
   Surveys were mailed to therapists (1,000 per discipline) with 594
   returned (OT = 216; PT = 219; SLP = 160). Descriptive data were analyzed
   for areas related to training that should be targeted for innovative
   programming. Results: Findings revealed that a variety of methods and
   structure were used to provide training in traditional rolerelated
   areas. Factors, which emerged that impacted caregiver training, were
   related to perceived caregiver attributes, coordination across the
   healthcare continuum, topics covered during training, and follow-up

Abstract = {Problem-solving therapies for family caregivers have been described for
   different dyads and care recipients with various chronic conditions.
   Only little attention is directed to the specific topics worked on with
   informal caregivers. This study focuses on the intensive intervention
   period of 3 months of an individualized mainly telephone-based
   problem-solving training for informal carers of stroke survivors
   (TIPS-Study). We present data of 47 strained caregivers who cared for
   their spouses and partners (n = 42) or (grand-) parents (n = 5). Results
   show that effective changes in burden can be achieved with only few
   contacts concentrating on problems that can be controlled by
   problem-focused coping mechanisms. Problems that require emotion-focused
   coping were processed rarely. Future perspectives of the approach are
   discussed.},

   implications for health care. Method: The study is an exploratory type
   of case study with a qualitative approach and the use of social
   representations theory. We interviewed 20 caregivers of stroke sequelae
   and Analysis is the method of content analysis. Results: Revealed three
   thematic units called Stroke social perceptions of caregivers, the zeal
   with Des-health and stroke and the stroke as a sudden illness, insidious
   and deadly. Conclusion: Learned that the caregivers perceive the stroke
   through negative feelings, where the lack of self-care provides the
   onset of the disease.},

Title = {Patient and caregiver satisfaction with rehabilitation services after

Journal = {REVISTA DE CALIDAD ASISTENCIAL},

Volume = {25},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Objectives: To assess patient and caregiver satisfaction with the
   regular rehabilitation care after stroke. To identify patient features
   or aspects of the rehabilitation programme related to lower rates of
   satisfaction in our area.
   Material and methods: Cross-sectional study of 74 stroke in-patients
   admitted from June 2005 to June 2006 (70.3\% men, age 65.4 +/- 12.2
   years, Barthel discharge 70.5 +/- 27). A telephone Satisfaction
   questionnaire (Pound 1999) was administered at 13.6 +/- 3.1 months to
   assess satisfaction regarding in-patient care, therapy and recovery, and
   services after hospital discharge. Three items addressed to caregiver
   satisfaction were also included. A total of 84 caregivers were
   identified: 71\% relatives (partner or children), of which 80.9\% were
   women.
   Results: The satisfaction questionnaire was completed by 52.9\% of
   patients. Over 80\% of interviewed patients were completely satisfied
   with in-patient care, and 52.7\% were satisfied with therapy and
   recovery during admission, but more patients were dissatisfied with the
   amount of therapy received. The lowest rate of satisfaction was related
   to the services after discharge, with less than 25\% of patients
   satisfied. A total of 83.1\% of caregivers completed the questionnaire,
   of which 74.1\% were satisfied with the information provided. Stroke
   educational training was given to 63.5\% of caregivers, and 42.4\% were
   given support after discharge. Only the presence of depression during
   admission and time passed after stroke were significantly related to
   patient satisfaction. (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Dissatisfaction with some aspects of stroke rehabilitation
   is considerable in our care area. Despite general patient and caregiver
   satisfaction regarding information provided, high dissatisfaction rates
   are also detected related to the amount of therapy and the social
   support provided after hospital discharge. According to these results,
   systematic information and training programs for patients and caregivers
   should be included in stroke rehabilitation, as well as providing social
   support at discharge. (C) 2009 SECA. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.

   in his final message at the end of 1 year of participation in this
   discussion group. He used each letter of the alphabet to choose a word
   that represented a theme for what he had discovered while caring for his
   wife. A secondary analysis project examined narrative data from all
   caregivers' e-mails to see whether support existed for the word themes
   in the ABCs poem. 2,148 e-mails were read and examined using content
   analysis to get a sense of the meaning of the content, and then key
   words were identified that matched each of the poem's word themes. Other
   caregivers' e-mail examples verified all 26 word themes of the ABCs
   poem. Nurses can use these themes when providing education and support
   interventions to stroke caregivers new to their new role.},

Abstract = {This prospective study aimed to describe the caregiver burden and its
   effects on stroke prognosis and to correlate socio-demographic
   variables. Three centers from two cities in Turkey participated in this
   study. One hundred and ninety eight stroke patients and their primary
   caregivers were included in the study for a follow up period of 6
   months. Stroke prognosis has been evaluated using Glasgow Coma Scale
   (GCS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIH-SS) and Barthel
   Index (BI). Caregiver burden have been studied using Caregiver Stress
   Scale (CSS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory
   (BDI). Our study showed that good prognosis of stroke sufferers is
   directly correlated with a good BAI and BDI performances but there was
   no correlation with CSS. Stroke prognosis was commonly affected by the
   city of residence and gender of the patients. On the other hand, age of
   the caregiver; both with the city of residence and the type of the
   hospital in the same city have significant effect on CSS performance.
   Caregiver gender and the city factor have significant effect on both BAI
   and BDI performances according to mixed model analysis. These data
   showed that caregiver burden is an important factor on stroke prognosis
   and these factors are significantly affected by both individual and
   local factors in the same country.},

Abstract = {Caregivers of stroke patients have needs that should be addressed. The
   aim of this study was to gain information regarding the expressed needs
   of informal caregivers of stroke patients who are receiving out-patient
   physiotherapy treatment at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka,
   Zambia. A qualitative study, using in-depth interviews, was carried out
   to collect data regarding the needs of these caregivers. Ten caregivers
   formed the study sample. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and
   analysed into themes that emerged from the data. Five themes relating to
   the needs of the caregivers emerged following the analysis of the data.
   These included: the lack of information regarding stroke; the need for
   skills training to enable the caregiver to assist the patient at home;
   the need for financial support; a need for home-based therapy and the
   need for physical assistance when caring for patients at home. The
   caregivers of patients need more information regarding strokes as well
   as a community-based rather than an institution-based approach to
   rehabilitation. Rehabilitation professionals in Zambia could use the
   information gained from this study to implement rehabilitation
   programmes, which would address the needs of caregivers in that country.},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the level of depression, anxiety and quality of
   life in primary caregivers for the severe stroke patients.
   Method: We studied a sample of 44 severe stroke patients and their
   primary caregivers. Functional status of the severe stroke patients was
   evaluated by Modified Barthel Index (MBI). We collected the data through
   interviewing the caregivers and using the Beck Depression Inventory
   (BDI), StateTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Ego-strength scale, Short
   Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) and Family APGAR (Adaptation, Partnership,
   Growth, Affection and Resolve) score.
   Results: The average level of depression in caregivers was low. The mean
   socres of STAI were 41.5 for state anxiety and 44.3 for trait anxiety,
   respectively. Ego-strength scale was significantly inversely related to
   BDI score and trait anxiety inventory score, but positively related to
   SF-36 score. The most influencing factor for the SF-36 score was the BDI
   score.
   Conclusion: Primary caregivers for the home-bound severe stroke patients
   demonstrated a lower level of quality of life, especially mental health,
   general health and vitality component. Community based rehabilitation
   should more focus on the evaluation and support for caregiver's
   psychologic status and their quality of life.},

Title = {Protective Role of Caregiver Preparedness on the Relationship Between
   Depression and Quality of Life in Stroke Dyads},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Depression and quality of life (QOL) have an
   interdependent and transactional nature in stroke survivor-caregiver
   dyads. While the strong relationship between depression and physical and
   emotional QOL in stroke survivor-caregiver dyads is well known, it is
   less clear if this relationship is moderated by caregiver preparedness,
   which could easily be targeted with interventions. In this study, we
   examined the moderating role of caregiver preparedness on the
   association between depression and QOL in stroke survivor-caregiver
   dyads. Methods: We used a longitudinal design with follow-ups every 3
   months over a 1-year period. Considering the nonindependent nature of
   the data (survivors and their caregivers), we used multilevel modeling
   to analyze data at the dyad level. We implemented 4 longitudinal dyadic
   moderation models (one for each QOL domain: physical, psychological,
   social, and environmental) using hierarchical linear modeling. Results:
   A sample of 222 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads was analyzed. Stroke
   survivors were older (M=70.8, SD=11.9) than their caregivers (M=52.4,
   SD=13.1). Stroke survivors predominantly had an ischemic stroke, equally
   distributed by site. Caregivers were primarily female (66\%), with a
   medium to high educational level (57\%). Caregiver preparedness
   significantly moderated the association between survivor depression and
   survivor psychological (B=0.56, P<0.01) and environmental (B=0.58,
   P<0.01) QOL at baseline and social QOL over time (B=0.24, P<0.05).
   Similarly, caregiver preparedness significantly moderated the
   association between caregiver depression and caregiver physical (B=0.25,
   P<0.01) and environmental (B=0.18, P<0.05) QOL over time. Conclusions:
   Caregiver preparedness has a positive influence on both members of the
   dyad. Assessment of stroke-caregiver preparedness could be helpful to
   motivate clinicians to develop and implement interventions for stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyads.},

Abstract = {Globally, there is a rise in incident cases of stroke, particularly in
   low- and middle-income countries, due to obesity-related and lifestyle
   risk factors, including health issues such as high cholesterol, diabetes
   and hypertension. Since the early 20th century, stroke mortality has
   declined due to proper management of the risk factors and improved
   treatment practices. However, despite the decline in mortality, there is
   an increase in the levels of disability that requires long-term support.
   In countries such as Australia and Denmark, where most care is provided
   within the community; family members, generally spouses, assume the role
   of caregiver, with little to no preparation that affects the quality of
   care provided to the person living with stroke. While past research has
   highlighted aspects to improve caregiver preparedness of stroke and its
   impact on care; health planning, recovery, and public health policies
   rarely consider these factors, reducing engagement and increasing
   uncertainty. Hence, there is a need to focus on improving strategies
   during recovery to promote caregiver engagement. In this study, we,
   therefore, try to understand the needs of the caregiver in stroke that
   limit engagement, and processes employed in countries such as Australia
   and Denmark to provide care for the person with stroke. Based on our
   understanding of these factors, we highlight the potential opportunities
   and challenges to promote caregiving engagement in these countries.},

Abstract = {Purpose The aim of the study was to design and evaluate a goal-setting
   tip sheet to improve stroke family caregiver health as part of the
   Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit program. Design A
   multimethod design using open-ended questions and rating forms was used
   in this study. Methods In two studies, the goal-setting tip sheet was
   evaluated by caregivers (N = 12; N = 6), researchers (N = 10; N = 3),
   clinicians (N = 8; N = 4), and technology experts (N = 4; N = 4).
   Rigorous qualitative content analysis procedures were used with
   descriptive statistics for ratings. Findings Qualitative strengths and
   areas for improvement refined the goal-setting tip sheet. From 1 =
   strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree, ratings averaged from 3.25 to
   5.00 for strategies, accuracy, feasibility, and acceptability.
   Conclusions The goal-setting tip sheet was found to be accurate,
   feasible, and acceptable. Future research is needed to determine the
   impact on caregiver health.},

Abstract = {Background: Vascular strokes are the leading cause of long-term
   disability for adults. They impose high levels of burden on the patient,
   the family, and national healthcare systems worldwide. This study aimed
   to assess the effects of patients' and caregivers' characteristics on
   the perceptions of burden in families caring for a loved one living with
   stroke in Greece. Methods: Using purposive sampling, 109 dyads of
   patients and their respective caregivers were recruited from the Attica
   region. Patients completed a questionnaire that included personal
   characteristics and the Barthel Index, while caregivers completed a set
   of questionnaires-personal characteristics, revised Bakas Caregiving
   Outcomes Scale (BCOS), Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ 2000), and
   Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D). Results:
   Caregiving burden was linked to both patients' and caregivers'
   characteristics. A patient's educational level, the number of family
   members living in the same house, the existence of equipment and
   facilities in the house, and the duration of provided care were
   associated with perception of greater burden. Regarding caregivers'
   characteristics, those in good health had a significantly lower
   perception of burden. Higher PRQ 2000 scores were significantly
   associated with higher BCOS scores (less burden), and higher CES-D
   scores were significantly associated with lower BCOS scores (more
   burden). Conclusion: Caring for a loved one affected by stroke places a
   considerable burden on the caregiver. Systematic assessment and
   intervention strategies can help to identify caregivers at risk so that
   suitably targeted assistance may be provided.},

Title = {The everyday life situation of caregivers to family members who have had
   a stroke and received the rehabilitation intervention F@ce in Uganda},

Abstract = {BackgroundStroke is increasing in Africa and consequences such as
   limitations in the performance of activities in everyday life persist a
   long time. A family member might need to care for and assist the person
   who has had a stroke. The life situation of these caregivers thereby
   changes, which could lead to increased workload and new responsibilities
   in caring for which they lack but request knowledge. During the F@ce
   rehabilitation program, the caregivers received counseling, which is
   uncommon in the African context. The aim of the study was twofold; (1)
   to investigate the perceived caregiver burden and life satisfaction and,
   (2) to explore and describe the life situation for caregivers to persons
   that have had a stroke and received the mobile phone supported
   rehabilitation F@ce in urban areas in Uganda.MethodA mixed method design
   was used. Twelve caregivers took part in a semi-structured interview
   regarding their everyday life situation and responded to questionnaires
   on caregiver burden and life satisfaction. Latent qualitative content
   analysis was used to analyse the interviews.ResultsFive categories were
   identified in the caregivers' experiences of their life situation: Feels
   obligated but is just a natural commitment; a tightly scheduled everyday
   life; being the supporting relative; the caregivers approach as
   rehabilitators; and being supported by the rehabilitation intervention.
   The caregivers rated relatively high on the Caregiver Burden Scale and
   two thirds of the sample rated their satisfaction with life as a whole
   as dissatisfying. Further ratings on the Life Satisfaction checklist
   revealed that the financial, vocational, leisure and family situations
   were dissatisfying.Conclusions F Even if it was viewed as a natural
   commitment to be a caregiver when a family member had had a stroke, the
   life situation changed substantially for those who took on the
   caregiving role. Caregiving responsibilities were challenging as well as
   a heavy workload and a strained financial situation as many were giving
   up on jobs. The participants felt burdened and rated a low life
   satisfaction. The F@ce intervention was, however, expressed as valued
   and involved support and advice in their caregiving situation as well as
   information on stroke which relieved stress among them.},

Title = {Living with consequences of stroke and risk factors for unhealthy diet-
   experiences among stroke survivors and caregivers in Nairobi, Kenya},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {BackgroundStroke prevalence is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa and has
   been partly attributed to the rapid economic and population growth that
   have contributed to changes in lifestyle and increased the prevalence of
   modifiable risk factors for stroke. Healthy diet is important in stroke
   management and secondary stroke prevention. The aim was to explore the
   clinical characteristics and functioning after stroke and the
   experiences of nutritional aspects among stroke survivors and caregivers
   in Nairobi, Kenya.MethodsA cross-sectional study with qualitative and
   quantitative methods involving two rounds of data collection was
   utilised. In the first round, data on demographics and clinical
   characteristics were collected for 30 people poststroke during a seminar
   organized by the Kenya Stroke Association. In the second round, nine
   participants then agreed to be interviewed together with their
   caregivers and asked to describe their own experiences and their
   household eating patterns after suffering a stroke. The food frequency
   questionnaire and anthropometric measurements of weight, height and
   waist measurements were used. The self-reported data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics and the transcribed interview texts used a
   constructivist-based theory.ResultsThe results give an insight in the
   life situation for people living with consequences after stroke and
   their caregivers in Nairobi. The participants were aware that they were
   overweight and that this indicated an increased risk for the development
   of cardiovascular diseases. A core category emerged: The caregiver as
   the main definer of health and enabler of healthy diet among persons who
   have had a stroke. Healthy diets and provided information on eating
   healthy were lacking from the healthcare professionals, whereupon the
   responsibility for managing a healthy diet had shifted to the
   caregivers.ConclusionsSupport needs to be given to people with stroke
   and their caregivers to achieve a healthy diet. The importance of
   healthy eating as a way of reducing the risk of suffering a stroke needs
   to be communicated by health care. The Kenyan food-based dietary
   guidelines need to be more implemented and accessible as well as an
   overall secondary stroke prevention program.},

Title = {The role of the social network during inpatient rehabilitation: A
   qualitative study exploring the views of older stroke survivors and
   their informal caregivers},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Background: After discharge, stroke survivors and their informal
   caregivers need support from their social networks to resume their most
   valued activities. Rehabilitation professionals could help them
   establish a strong support system.
   Objective: Explore how older stroke survivors and their primary informal
   caregivers expect to resume their valued activities after discharge, and
   discover their ideas about involving, informing and educating their
   family members, friends and important others during inpatient
   rehabilitation so that, once home, they will have adequate support.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with stroke survivors
   from three geriatric rehabilitation centres and their primary informal
   caregivers, used the pictures of daily activities to elicit their
   perspectives, and applied a descriptive and interpretive design to data
   analysis.
   Results: Many participants had no concrete idea about how to resume
   their activities after discharge but nevertheless were optimistic they
   would. They expected help to be available and saw no need for
   professionals to involve their network during inpatient rehabilitation.
   However, once they had insight into the challenges to expect after
   discharge, they often appreciated the idea of professionals contacting
   their network. To better understand the challenges after discharge, it
   was helpful if professionals provided concrete, honest information about
   the stroke's consequences for daily life. Actually doing daily
   activities also helped gain better insights.
   Conclusions: To enhance insight in the need of social support after
   discharge, we suggest that rehabilitation professionals are honest about
   what to expect and let stroke survivors explore their valued activities
   in a realistic context more often.},

Abstract = {Aim Patients with stroke experience various challenges such as motor and
   cognitive and sensory problems, which can increase the caregiver burden
   of family members in long-term care. Understanding the factors related
   to caregiver burden is important to develop strategies to support
   informal caregivers. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the
   relationship of religious coping strategies and family harmony to
   caregiver burden for family members of patients with stroke. Method The
   sample of this descriptive, cross-sectional study consisted of 181
   family caregivers who completed the Religious Coping Scale, Burden
   Interview Scale, and Family Harmony Scale - Short Form. Multiple linear
   regression and Pearson's correlation were performed. Results Pearson's
   correlation analysis indicated a significant positive relationship
   between caregiver burden and negative religious coping. A significant
   negative relationship was found of caregiver burden and family harmony
   with positive religious coping. Multiple regression analysis indicated
   that family harmony, amount of time spent on caregiving, and negative
   and positive religious coping were predictors of caregiver burden. Given
   the significant relationship of caregiver burden and family harmony to
   positive religious coping, future research should integrate religious
   coping strategies into multidisciplinary caregiver intervention programs
   to reduce caregiver burden.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To explore the changes in perceived barriers and facilitators
   associated with participation in secondary prevention activities of
   stroke survivors and their caregivers over the early stroke recovery
   period. Method: We conducted two individual interviews (at 2 weeks and 6
   months post-discharge) with stroke survivors and their family members.
   Using purposive sampling, participants were recruited from the stroke
   units of two acute care hospitals. Results: About 11 male and 8 female
   stroke survivors and nine caregivers participated in the study. Thematic
   analysis identified three themes. (1) ``A soul searching experience{''}
   indicating that the stroke was anxiety provoking leading to a soul
   searching experience into exploring its causes to adopt a healthy
   lifestyle; (2) ``Old habits die hard{''} revealing that stroke survivors
   encountered barriers to adopt healthy lifestyle changes; (3) ``Making a
   fresh start{''} recognizing that participants were motivated to make
   their lifestyle healthier and most sustained some lifestyle changes over
   the past 6 months. Conclusion: Despite experiencing some barriers,
   stroke survivors adopted lifestyle changes transitioning through
   different stages of change. Stroke prevention education and
   interventions from experts would be helpful later in the rehabilitation
   phase (once at home) and adopting a patient-family centered approach may
   assist stroke survivors and their caregivers in the uptake of secondary
   stroke prevention activities.},

Abstract = {Background: A cross-sectional survey was performed on the family members
   of disabled stroke survivors, those who are both the patient's medical
   authorizer and caregiver, to identify the sources of the caring stress
   and inform appropriate interventions.
   Methods: A total of 242 family members of stroke patients, who were
   treated in a tertiary geriatric hospital in Haikou, the capital city of
   Hainan Province, were enrolled in the current study by using convenience
   sampling. Questionnaire forms were used to investigate care stress
   caused by family members' current care activities and analyze its
   causes.
   Results: The care stress of the family members was moderately positively
   correlated with financial pressure (r=0.476, P<0.01). Family members'
   educational background, financial pressure, the times of
   hospitalizations, the dependency of stroke patients, and the degree of
   family members' participation in treatment decision-making during the
   patient's hospital stay were the primary sources of the caring stress
   (P<0.05 or P<0.01).
   Conclusions: A substantial proportion of family members are under high
   stress when caring for disabled stroke patients. Strategies including
   knowledge training, empowerment, home-based rehabilitation, and
   information and emotional support may effectively relieve the caring
   stress, to improve the family support of patients, improve the quality
   of life of both patients and caregivers, and enhance the rehabilitation
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {We developed a 64 channel sensory electrical stimulator which delivers a
   dynamic and variable `Sensory Barrage' Stimulation (SBS). Our aim was to
   assess the feasibility of caregivers delivering the stimulation in the
   community for a clinical trial comparing single channel Transcutaneous
   Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) with SBS for post stroke upper limb
   spasticity. We trained caregivers of 16 participants with post stroke
   upper limb spasticity to sequentially administer SBS and TENS for 60 min
   daily for four weeks each, with a washout period of two weeks in
   between. Outcome measures tested were recruitment and retention rates,
   compliance with interventions and daily recording of Participant
   -reported Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). We also collected results of
   Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Leeds Arm Spasticity Impact Scale
   (LASIS) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for spasticity. Out of 21
   potential participants, 16 consented and 15 completed the protocol. Ten
   participants received TENS for 80\% (23/28) of the intended hours.
   Eleven participants completed NRS for at 80\% (45/56) of the study days.
   All participants attended all visits. The MAS reduced by at least one in
   five participants after SBS and in three after TENS. Minimal Clinically
   Important Difference (MCID) of four points increase in ARAT was seen in
   five participants following TENS, and in four following SBS. A MCID of
   18\% decrease in NRS was reported by eight participants after TENS and
   three after SBS. This study demonstrated the feasibility of undertaking
   a trial of sensory electrical stimulation for post-stroke spasticity
   with caregivers delivering intervention in community. The study was not
   powered to detect efficacy of the interventions.},

Title = {Long-term care use after a stroke or femoral fracture and the role of
   family caregivers},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {Background There has been a shift from institutional care towards home
   care, and from formal to informal care to contain long-term care (LTC)
   costs in many countries. However, substitution to home care or informal
   care might be harder to achieve for some conditions than for others.
   Therefore, insight is needed in differences in LTC use, and the role of
   potential informal care givers, across specific conditions. We analyze
   differences in LTC use of previously independent older patients after a
   fracture of femur and stroke, and in particular examine to what extent
   having a partner and children affects LTC use for these conditions.
   Methods Using administrative data on Dutch previously independent older
   people (55+) with a fracture of femur or stroke in 2013, we investigate
   their LTC use in the year after the condition takes place. We use
   administrative treatment data to select individuals who were treated by
   a medical specialist for a stroke or femoral fracture in 2013.
   Subsequent LTC use is measured as using no formal care, home care,
   institutional care or being deceased at 13 consecutive four-weekly
   periods after initial treatment. We relate long-term care use to having
   a partner, having children, other personal characteristics and the
   living environment. Results The probability to use no formal care 1 year
   after the initial treatment is equally high for both conditions, but
   patients with a fracture are more likely to use home care, while
   patients with a stroke are more likely to use institutional care or have
   died. Having a spouse has a negative effect on home care and
   institutional care use, but the timing of the effect, especially for
   institutional care, differs strongly between the two conditions. Having
   children also has a negative effect on formal care use, and this effect
   is consistently larger for patients with a fracture than patients with a
   stroke. Conclusion As the condition and the effect of potential informal
   care givers matter for subsequent long-term care use, policy makers
   should take the expected prevalence of specific conditions within the
   older people population into account when designing long-term care
   policies.},

Abstract = {Purpose Studies have shown that spirituality plays an important role in
   enhancing the quality of life of stroke survivors and their caregivers.
   Spirituality has been associated with positive patient and caregiver
   outcomes, so a valid, reliable measure of spirituality is important. It
   has not been tested with stroke survivors and their caregivers, so the
   aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the
   World Health Organization Quality of Life Spiritual Religious and
   Personal Belief (WHOQOL-SRPB) scale for stroke survivors and their
   caregivers. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 414 stroke survivors
   at 10 rehabilitation hospitals and 244 caregivers completed the
   WHOQOL-SRPB. The WHOQOL-SRPB's factorial structure was assessed with
   confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), criterion-related validity was
   evaluated with the WHOQOL-BREF, and internal consistency reliability was
   assessed with Cronbach's alpha and ordinal alpha. Results The CFA
   results supported the hypothesized eight-factor structure. The stroke
   survivor and the caregiver versions of the model both had excellent fit
   indices. The factor loadings for the final models were strong: 0.78-0.98
   for stroke survivors and caregivers (p < 0.001). The criterion-related
   validity for the WHOQOL-SRPB showed weak to moderate correlations with
   all the WHOQOL-BREF dimensions. Both ordinal alpha and Cronbach's alpha
   had values more than 0.70. Conclusions The WHOQOL-SRPB scale is a valid,
   reliable instrument for measuring spirituality in stroke survivors and
   caregivers. Given the importance of spirituality for stroke survivors
   and caregivers, the WHOQOL-SRPB scale is recommended as an important
   tool for clinical practice and research.},

Abstract = {Background: The relationship between stroke survivors and family
   caregivers is critical for the well-being of both dyad members.
   Currently, there are few interventions targeted at dyads and focused on
   strengthening the relationship between survivors and family caregivers.
   Objectives: This study reports on the development of a customizable,
   strengths-based, relationship-focused intervention driven by the
   real-world experience and advice of stroke dyads. It also describes the
   ``tips{''} that survivors and family caregivers offered for dealing with
   relationship challenges after stroke. Methods: Content of the
   intervention, including relationship tips, was derived from
   semi-structured interviews with N= 19 stroke dyads. A modified Delphi
   process with a national panel of 10 subject matter experts was used to
   evaluate and refine the content of the intervention and the associated
   screening tool. Results: Seventeen domains of relationship challenges
   and tips were identified. Consensus was reached among experts that the
   intervention content was relevant to the goal of helping survivors and
   family caregivers maintain a strong relationship after stroke; (2) clear
   from the perspective of stroke survivors and family caregivers who would
   be using it; (3) accurate with respect to the advice being offered, and;
   (4) useful for helping stroke survivors and family caregivers improve
   the quality of their relationship. Conclusions: This study extends the
   limited body of research about dyadic interventions after stroke. The
   next steps in this line of research include feasibility testing the
   intervention and evaluating its efficacy in a larger trial.},

Abstract = {Background \& aims: Malnutrition problems are very common after a
   stroke. Several clinical studies have shown the contribution of
   percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding after stroke in terms
   of improving nutritional status and reducing mortality. The aim of this
   study is to compare the burden and depression among caregivers of
   ischemic stroke patients fed with PEG and orally.
   Methods: A total of 63 caregivers of patients with acute ischemic stroke
   who were followed up in the neurointensive care unit with modified
   Rankin Scale 4 or 5 were recruited in this cross-sectional survey.
   Clinical data of patients and demographical profile as age, gender,
   kinship to patient, income, and level of education of caregivers were
   recorded. On their 3rd-month follow-up visit, Beck Depression Inventory
   and The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were administered to caregivers to
   evaluate depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. A semi-structured
   questionnairre was developed and conducted by the researchers with the
   caregivers to assess their thoughts of nutrition.
   Results: Thirty-two caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and 31
   caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally were evaluated. The
   groups did not differ statistically in terms of demographic variables
   and depression scores (p > 0.05). However, the mean score of ZBI was
   significantly higher in the group of caregivers of stroke patients who
   were fed orally (p = 0.00). Caregivers of stroke patients on PEG had
   higher scores of caregivers' thoughts of nutrition support therapy
   questionnairre (p = 0.00).
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that caregivers of stroke patients
   report lower burden and higher level of positive thinking with PEG
   feeding than oral feeding. This suggests that nutritional care could
   include convenient and practicable methods for caregivers of patients
   with stroke in order to meet patients' nutritional requirements. (C)

Title = {Association between caregiver engagement and patient-reported healthcare

Abstract = {Background: Caregivers (CGs) are critical in helping stroke survivors
   (SSs) retain function and receive adequate healthcare. Objectives: We
   aimed to identify the activities that CGs are engaged in over the course
   of stroke care from open-ended SS interviews and explore the association
   between CG engagement and SS healthcare utilization post-stroke.
   Methods: We qualitatively analyzed 9-month post-stroke interviews with
   118 SSs about their experiences before, during and following acute care
   from the Caring for Adults Recovering from the Effects of Stroke (CARES)
   study. We classified each SS as having either an engaged or non-engaged
   CG based on whether the SS indicated CG involvement in any part of their
   stroke care. We compared differences between groups in self-reported use
   of outpatient therapy, home health care, ambulatory care, mental health
   services, and acute care. Results: SSs who were interviewed most often
   described CG involvement as driving the SS to the hospital or calling
   911 (n = 48; 23.4\%), coordinating medical appointments (n = 43; 21.0\%)
   and monitoring recovery (n = 23; 11.2\%). SSs with engaged CGs were more
   likely to see a speech-language pathologist and had more emergency room
   visits compared to those with non-engaged CGs. No differences were
   observed after adjusting for stroke severity. Conclusions: Higher rates
   of healthcare utilization by SSs with engaged CGs may be driven by
   greater stroke severity and greater need for services. Interestingly,
   the presence of an engaged CG did not facilitate more care for the SS
   after adjusting for stroke severity.},

Abstract = {This longitudinal mixed-method study examined the types of help provided
   by caregivers to optimize participation of older adults with cognitive
   deficits post-stroke (care recipients), and how these types of help
   varied with caregiver's burden. Twelve family caregivers of care
   recipients post-stroke completed a burden questionnaire and
   semi-structured interviews one month, three months, and six months
   following care recipient's discharge home from acute care,
   rehabilitation, or day hospital. Care recipients completed cognitive
   tests and a social participation questionnaire. Types of help caregivers
   provided differed according to the amount of daily living support,
   degree of concern for care recipient's well-being, and impact on
   caregivers' social life. Interestingly, types of help fostering care
   recipient's social participation, self-esteem, and abilities were
   unrelated to a negative impact on caregivers' social life. Understanding
   how different types of help relate to caregiver burden could improve the
   types of help to optimize care recipients' social participation without
   overburdening caregivers.},

   its complications among people living with stroke, and their caregivers,
   in two urban poor communities in Accra (Ga Mashie) and Korle Bu Teaching
   Hospital (KBTH), Accra. Methods: Twenty-two stroke survivors and 29
   caregivers were recruited from 2 urban poor communities in Accra and
   KBTH. Qualitative data were obtained using semi-structured interviews
   that lasted between 45 minutes and 2 hours. The interviews were
   audiotaped, transcribed and analysed thematically, informed by the
   concept of EMs of illness. Results: Participants referred to stroke as a
   sudden event and they expressed different emotional responses after the
   stroke onset. Stroke survivors and their caregivers attributed stroke
   with poor lifestyle practices, high blood pressure, unhealthy diet and
   dietary practices, supernatural causes, stress, family history, other
   chronic diseases, and delay in treatment of symptoms. While the stroke
   survivors associated stroke complications with physical disability and
   stigmatisation, the caregivers associated these with physical
   disability, behavioural and psychological changes, cognitive disability
   and death. These associations were mostly influenced by the biomedical
   model of stroke. Conclusion: The biomedical model of stroke is important
   for developing interventions that will be accepted by the stroke
   survivors and the caregivers. Nevertheless, sociocultural explanations
   of stroke need to be taken into consideration during delivery of medical
   information to the participants. This study proposes an integrated
   biopsychosociocultural approach for stroke intervention among the study
   participants.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke can be seen as a family matter, and nearly all stroke
   patients live with their families in their communities. Comprehensive
   insights into stroke recovery from family caregivers' point of view are
   lacking.
   Objectives: The aim of the present study is to explore and describe
   family caregivers' experiences about the contributing elements of
   promoting the stroke recovery of older adults in the Iranian context.
   Methods: A qualitative content analysis approach was conducted. From
   September 2013 to April 2014, 17 family caregivers from multiple
   physiotherapy clinics in Sari, Iran, participated in this study. Data
   were generated through in-depth interviews, and the content analysis
   method was used to determine themes.
   Results: The results of data analysis were categorized into three main
   themes: 1) promoting functional recovery; 2) improving psychological
   health; and 3) strengthening social roles. The general, overarching
   theme was promoting positive recovery.
   Conclusions: The family positively figures in the stroke patient's
   recovery. Health practitioners must help the stroke families effectively
   play their critical roles in helping their stroke patients recover.},

Title = {Can caregivers report their care recipients' post-stroke

   prospective stroke cohort},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Background: Health services research aimed at understanding service use
   and improving resource allocation often relies on collecting
   subjectively reported or proxy-reported healthcare service utilization
   (HSU) data. It is important to know the discrepancies in such self or
   proxy reports, as they have significant financial and policy
   implications. In high-dependency populations, such as stroke survivors,
   with varying levels of cognitive impairment and dysphasia, caregivers
   are often potential sources of stroke survivors' HSU information. Most
   of the work conducted on agreement analysis to date has focused on
   validating different sources of self-reported data, with few studies
   exploring the validity of caregiver-reported data. Addressing this gap,
   our study aimed to quantify the agreement across the caregiver-reported
   and national claims-based HSU of stroke patients.
   Methods: A prospective study comprising multi-ethnic stroke patient and
   caregiver dyads (N = 485) in Singapore was the basis of the current
   analysis, which used linked national claims records. Caregiver-reported
   health services data were collected via face-to-face and telephone
   interviews, and similar health services data were extracted from the
   national claims records. The main outcome variable was the modified
   intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which provided the level of
   agreement across both data sources. We further identified the amount of
   over-or under-reporting by caregivers across different service types.
   Results: We observed variations in agreement for different health
   services, with agreement across caregiver reports and national claims
   records being the highest for outpatient visits (specialist and primary
   care), followed by hospitalizations and emergency department visits.
   Interestingly, caregivers over- reported hospitalizations by
   approximately 49\% and under-reported specialist and primary care visits
   by approximately 20 to 30\%.
   Conclusions: The accuracy of the caregiver-reported HSU of stroke
   patients varies across different service types. Relatively more
   objective data sources, such as national claims records, should be
   considered as a first choice for quantifying health care usage before
   considering caregiver-reported usage. Caregiver-reported outpatient
   service use was relatively more accurate than inpatient service use over
   shorter recall periods. Therefore, in situations where objective data
   sources are limited, caregiver-reported outpatient information can be
   considered for low volumes of healthcare consumption, using an
   appropriate correction to account for potential under-reporting.},

Title = {Translating knowledge for action against stroke - using 5-minute videos
   for stroke survivors and caregivers to improve post-stroke outcomes:
   study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (Movies4Stroke)},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Background: Two thirds of the global mortality of stroke is borne by low
   and middle income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is the world's sixth most
   populous country with a stroke-vulnerable population and is without a
   single dedicated chronic care center. In order to provide evidence for a
   viable solution responsive to this health care gap, and leveraging the
   existing >70 \% mobile phone density, we thought it rational to test the
   effectiveness of a mobile phone-based video intervention of short
   5-minute movies to educate and support stroke survivors and their
   primary caregivers.
   Methods: Movies4Stroke will be a randomized control, outcome assessor
   blinded, parallel group, single center superiority trial. Participants
   with an acute stroke, medically stable, with mild to moderate disability
   and having a stable primary caregiver will be included. After obtaining
   informed consent the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad will be randomized.
   Intervention participants will have the movie program software installed
   in their phone, desktop, or Android device which will allow them to
   receive, view and repeat 5-minute videos on stroke-related topics at
   admission, discharge and first and third months after enrollment. The
   control arm will receive standard of care at an internationally
   accredited center with defined protocols. The primary outcome measure is
   medication adherence as ascertained by a locally validated Morisky
   Medication Adherence Scale and control of major risk factors such as
   blood pressure, blood sugar and blood cholesterol at 12 months post
   discharge. Secondary outcome measures are post-stroke complications and
   mortality, caregiver knowledge and change in functional outcomes after
   acute stroke at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Movies4Stroke is designed to
   enroll 300 participant dyads after inflating 10 \% to incorporate
   attrition and noncompliance and has been powered at 95 \% to detect a 15
   \% difference between intervention and usual care arm. Analysis will be
   done by the intention-to-treat principle.
   Discussion: Movies4Stroke is a randomized trial testing an application
   aimed at supporting caregivers and stroke survivors in a LMIC with no
   rehabilitation or chronic support systems.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose There is a growing consensus among healthcare
   researchers that, within the field of family caregiving,
   cost-effectiveness research is needed to determine which programs have
   the greatest benefit for family members. This study examines the cost
   per caregiver of an intervention designed to improve the quality of life
   of spousal caregivers of stroke survivors. Method Cost data from the
   CAReS study were analyzed to determine the cost of the intervention per
   caregiver. Results The cost of the intervention per caregiver was
   \$2,500 at the 2009 median wage estimate. It was \$1,700 at the 2009 10
   percentile wage estimate and \$3,500 at the 2009 90 percentile wage
   estimate. Conclusions This study provides a prototype cost analysis from
   which researchers can build. In future analyses, costs should be tracked
   at a participant level so uncertainty can be calculated using the
   bias-corrected percentile bootstrapping method and plotted to calculate
   cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, enabling cost-effectiveness
   comparisons between interventions.},

Abstract = {The aims of this project were to explore the needs of family caregivers
   in the Chinese-American community and to develop training videos for
   caregivers on dressing stroke survivors. In-depth, semi-structured,
   open-ended interviews were used to explore the problems of caregivers of
   stroke survivors. Forty participants were recruited from
   Chinese-American communities. Verbatim interview transcripts were coded
   and analyzed. Four main concerns emerged: the impact and adjustment in
   lifestyle for family caregivers; lack of social activities and failure
   to seek community support; physical and mental stress and methods to
   alleviate stress, such as instruction in heavy lifting and guidance for
   daily activities, which include dressing. An 18-min video was produced
   to provide instruction on dressing stroke survivors for those who need
   this information. Also, this article addresses the lack of social

Abstract = {Aim: The present study aimed at investigating whether stroke patients
   benefit from their spouses attending a psychotherapeutic group
   intervention, in terms of improved functioning level and quality of
   life.
   Method: Within the scope of a panel study with control group design, n =
   124, stroke patients were interviewed using standardized questionnaires,
   regarding competences of daily life (PCRS) and quality of life (WHOQoL).
   In the intervention group, the patients' spouses attended a
   psychotherapeutic group intervention; the spouses of two control groups
   merely received illness-related information. Data was evaluated
   statistically by means of multiple regression analysis.
   Results: No statistically significant effects of the caregiver
   intervention on the patients were found. However, patients of the
   intervention group tended to report improved quality of life in the
   course of the study period, whereas subjective quality of life worsened
   for patients of the control groups. In all groups, impairments of
   everyday-life competences increased.
   Discussion: The results of this study suggest that psychotherapeutic
   group intervention for caregivers also has positive side effects on the
   patients. Further research is necessary in order to provide a better
   understanding of the mechanisms at work behind these positive side
   effects. Assistance concepts for spouses of stroke patients should
   utilize such intermediary effects more systematically.},

Abstract = {Background: Relatives who care for stroke survivors at home provide
   extensive emotional, social and physical care, which can be perceived as
   a burden. Literature reveals inconsistencies in predicting caregivers'
   subjective burden. Objectives: The purpose of this analysis was to
   identify predictors of caregivers' subjective burden in a German
   population of caregivers of stroke patients. Method: We analyzed data
   from a subsample of caregivers of stroke patients (N = 466) from a
   larger cross sectional German study. We built a structural equation
   model, including patient, caregiver and situation characteristics as
   predictor variables and subjective burden as the outcome variable.
   Subjective burden was measured with the Burden Scale for Family
   Caregivers. Results: Caregivers are at higher risk to develop burden
   when they are younger, their own health status is poor, the workload is
   high or the patients' behavior has changed. The strongest predictor of
   caregiver burden was the caregivers' negative appraisal of the
   caregiving situation that correlated with feelings of being pressured
   into caregiving or not being oneself. The predictive relationship of
   nocturnal workload to caregiver burden was inconsistent, while the
   patient's mental state, drive, and age did not significantly impact
   caregiver burden. Discussion: Caregiver burden is influenced by a number
   of factors, but the negative appraisal of the situation by the caregiver
   is the key to assessing the amount of burden caregivers experience in
   caring for a stroke patient. Task oriented professional support reduces
   the workload of caregivers, but does not reduce their subjective burden.
   Caregivers need additional psychosocial support in order to cope with
   their role.},

Abstract = {Forty-five family caregivers participated in the feedback session on the
   neuropsychological test results of their close ones, victims of stroke.
   Following the feedback, the caregivers were presented with an open-ended
   list of concerns regarding the patients' level of functioning and care
   needs, and were asked to identify the concerns which they had and the
   challenge that they represented to them. A hierarchy of concerns was
   established based upon their frequency and the challenge that they
   represented. Results indicated that `making sure that the patient is
   safe at all times, `knowing what his/her future needs will be,'knowing
   what to do in specific situations in which the patient is unable to
   perform the task independently' and `dealing with the emotional aspects
   of the patient' are the caregivers' most prominent concerns. The
   hierarchy of concerns is discussed from the perspective of its relevance
   to clinical work and the need for clinicians to incorporate it in plans
   for rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {Background Although several authors have analyzed the effects of
   spirituality on stroke survivors' physical functioning and on their own
   caregiver's outcomes, such as quality of life, only few authors have
   explored the interaction between spirituality and anxiety and depression
   using a dyadic approach. Objectives The aim of this study was to analyze
   the influence of spirituality in the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad and
   specifically on anxiety and depression in both parties. Methods A total
   of 217 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads were enrolled at discharge from
   several rehabilitation hospitals in central and southern Italy. The
   actor-partner interdependence model was used to analyze the dyadic data.
   To verify the differences in the effects between survivors and
   caregivers, comparisons were made between the chi(2) values of the model
   in which actor and partner effects were constrained to be equal. Results
   The average age of stroke survivors and their caregivers at baseline was
   71.2 and 52.7 years, respectively. Among the stroke survivors, there
   were slightly more men than women, whereas 65\% of the caregivers were
   women. Most stroke survivors had had an ischemic stroke. Four
   statistically significant actor effects were identified. Higher
   survivors' and caregivers' spirituality was associated with higher
   survivor and caregiver anxiety. The only significant partner effect that
   was identified was the association between stroke survivor spirituality
   and caregiver depression. Conclusions This study highlights the
   importance of studying spirituality in the population with stroke.
   Spirituality seems to play an important protective role in both stroke
   survivors' and caregivers' depression but not in anxiety.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: By 2030, there will be approximately 7.6 million stroke
   survivors (SSs) in the United States, yet comprehensive transitional
   care (TC) for stroke is not widely available. Stroke strikes without
   warning and leaves in its wake a ``storm{''} of uncertainty for SSs and
   caregivers (CGs) as they encounter a myriad of unmet physical, mental,
   emotional, and financial needs that are not wholly addressed by passive
   healthcare delivery systems. Needed is a stroke-specific TC model that
   bridges this storm to active delivery of SS and CG postacute care.
   Naylor's Transitional Care Model (NTCM) has not been examined for how it
   can frame comprehensive stroke care. The purpose of this study was to
   solicit SS and CG descriptions of TC experiences to inform the NTCM with
   refined operational definitions and exemplars specific to stroke.
   METHODS: Focus groups conducted for this qualitative descriptive study
   were guided by interview questions based on the 8 NTCM operational
   definitions. Data were analyzed using inductive and deductive
   qualitative content analysis methods. RESULTS: Post-acute-stroke care
   does not comprehensively meet the needs of SSs and CGs. Participants
   described TC deficits across all 8 NTCM components. Two new
   subcomponents that could be applied for a stroke-specific NTCM emerged:
   psychological and transportation challenges. CONCLUSION: Unmet needs
   identified by SSs and CGs were used to extend NTCM specific to the
   stroke population and to develop the Recommendations and Exemplars for
   Stroke Specific Comprehensive Transitional Care Delivery (see
   Supplementary Digital Content, available at
   http://linksiww.com/JNN/A385) . Researchers and practitioners can use
   the findings to develop and deliver more comprehensive TC to SSs and
   CGs.},

Title = {Stroke Rehabilitation Use and Caregiver Psychosocial Health Profiles in
   Singapore: A Latent Profile Transition Analysis},

Abstract = {Objectives: To identify and describe caregiver profiles based on their
   psychosocial health characteristics over a 12-month period and
   transitions among these profiles, to determine if stroke rehabilitation
   use at 12 months post-stroke differed by caregiver profile transition
   patterns, and to investigate if caregiver profiles at 3 months
   post-stroke moderate the association of stroke rehabilitation use at 3
   months and 12 months post-stroke after accounting for covariates.
   Design: Latent profile transition analysis of caregiver psychosocial
   health with stroke rehabilitation use at 12 month post-stroke as
   outcome. Setting and Participants: A total of 149 stroke
   patient-caregiver dyads from the Singapore Stroke Study. Methods:
   Cross-sectional latent profile analyses were conducted on caregiver
   psychosocial health indicators of burden, depression, health status,
   quality of relationship with patient, and social support. Changes in
   latent profile classification over 3 time points (baseline, 3 months,
   and 12 months post stroke) were analyzed using latent transition
   analysis. A transition model with stroke rehabilitation use at 12 months
   post-stroke as the outcome was tested after accounting for covariates.
   Results: Two distinct caregiver psychosocial health latent profiles were
   found across time: nondistressed and distressed. Most caregivers were
   classified as nondistressed and remained nondistressed over time.
   Distressed caregivers at baseline were 76\% likely to become
   nondistressed at 12 month post-stroke. Regardless of profile transition
   patterns, nondistressed caregivers at 12 months post-stroke tended to
   have cared for stroke rehabilitation nonusers at 12 months post-stroke.
   Patient depression explained profile classification at 3 months and 12
   months post-stroke. After accounting for covariates, rehabilitation
   users at 3 months post-stroke tended to continue using rehabilitation at
   12 months post-stroke only when they had nondistressed caregivers at 3
   months post-stroke. Conclusions and Implications: Whether caregiver
   adaptation explains the associations between the latent profile
   transition patterns and rehabilitation use at 12 months post-stroke

Title = {An Exploratory Qualitative Study With Older Malaysian Stroke Survivors,
   Caregivers, and Healthcare Practitioners About Falls and Rehabilitation
   for Falls After Stroke},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Studies on rehabilitation for falls after a stroke remain
   limited despite its impact being profound. This scenario justifies a
   deeper understanding of why falls in stroke rehabilitation received less
   attention. Current investigations on the perception of falls and stroke
   also proved inadequate. Therefore, this study aims to explore the
   perceptions and experiences of older Malaysian stroke survivors, spousal
   caregivers, and healthcare practitioners on falls in stroke
   rehabilitation.
   Method: A qualitative study of three focus groups with 18 individuals
   from one community-based stroke rehabilitation center was conducted. The
   discussions were audio-recorded, video-recorded, transcribed,
   summarized, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis: (i) perceived factors
   and consequences of falls after stroke, (ii) physical-based
   interventions predominate in rehabilitation for falls after stroke, and
   (iii) the role of home hazards in fall prevention is taken for granted.
   Although, awareness of falls is high, they are regarded as a peripheral
   issue in stroke. Rehabilitation interventions such as improved
   functionality are believed to be adequate and can indirectly prevent
   falls. Other interventions for fall prevention such as home hazards
   management are relatively less known.
   Conclusion: There is a need for more attention regarding home
   environment risk assessment and intervention among healthcare
   professionals, and more education for clients and caregivers is
   required. Although, other stroke interventions may also benefit stroke
   survivors, falls prevention should be a central component in stroke
   rehabilitation. As this study focused on a specific population, the
   findings should be validated with larger populations, and in diverse
   settings.},

Title = {The effect of a supportive home care program on caregiver burden with
   stroke patients in Iran: an experimental study},

Abstract = {Background Stroke can impose a heavy burden on caregivers. Caring for
   stroke patients at home is more challenging than in hospitals with
   facilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a
   supportive home care program on caregiver burden with stroke patients.
   Methods This was an experimental study. One hundred sixteen caregivers
   of stroke patients were recruited using convenience sampling from two
   university-affiliated hospitals in Tehran from June 2019 to February
   2020. They were randomly allocated into two groups (supportive home care
   program and routine hospital education program) using a randomized block
   design. The supportive home care program included eight educational
   sessions delivered in the hospital before discharge, and with home
   visits after hospital discharge. Caregiver burden was measured using
   Caregiver Burden Inventory. The data were analyzed using independent
   samples t-test and Analysis of Covariance. Results Caregiver burden in
   the routine education group increased significantly after 2 weeks, from
   52.27 +/- 23.95 to 62.63 +/- 22.68. The mean of caregiver burden scores
   in the supportive home care program decreased from 44.75 +/- 17.21 to
   40.46 +/- 17.28. The difference between the scores of the two groups
   before the intervention was not significantly different (t = 1.941, df =
   114, p = 0.055). There was a significant difference between the two
   groups regarding caregiver burden scores after the intervention period
   (eta(2) = 0.305, P < 0.001). Conclusions Caregiver burden increased
   significantly after the discharge without proper interventions in the
   caregivers of stroke patients. Providing support for home care providers
   can help to decrease or prevent the intensification of caregiver burden.},

Title = {Types of stroke-related deficits and their impact on family caregiver's

Abstract = {Background: Stroke caregiving has been associated with higher rates of
   caregiver burden, depression, and lower quality of life compared to
   non-caregivers. Little is known about relationships between stroke
   survivors' Cognitive/Emotional and Motor/Functional deficits and
   caregivers' outcomes.
   Objective: To determine the relationship between stroke survivors'
   Cognitive/Emotional deficits and Motor/Functional deficits and
   caregivers' depression, burden, and quality of life.
   Method: This is a retrospective secondary data analysis. The sample
   consisted of 109 caregivers of stroke survivors. Step-wise linear
   multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine if Cognitive/
   Emotional deficits and/or Motor/Functional deficits, were predictive of
   caregivers' depressive symptoms, burden, physical quality of life, and
   mental quality of life.
   Results: The Cognitive/Emotional deficits category was a better
   predictor than the Motor/Functional deficit of caregivers' depressive
   symptoms, burden, and mental quality of life. The Cognitive/Emotional
   deficit score positively predicted both depression (b = .49, p < .001)
   and burden (b = 0.39, p < .001) and negatively predicted mental quality
   of life (b =-0.42, p < .001), though it did not significantly predict
   physical quality of life (b =-0.01, p = .90). The motor/functional
   deficits failed to significantly predict any of the caregiver outcomes
   (all p-values >.05).
   Conclusions: The Cognitive/Emotional deficits appear to impact caregiver
   well-being more than the Motor/Functional deficits. Understanding the
   impact of Cognitive/Emotional and Motor/Functional def-icits on
   caregivers can help clinicians identify caregivers at the highest risk
   for negative outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy in Sleep Disorder and Depressive
   Symptoms Among Chinese Caregivers of Stroke Inpatients: A Structural
   Equation Modeling Analysis},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {3635-3643},
Abstract = {Purpose: Caregivers of stroke inpatients are at high risk of sleep
   disorder, which may lead to depressive symptoms. Self-efficacy has
   always been regarded as a protective factor against psychological
   disorders such as depressive symptoms. This study aims to investigate
   the sleep disorder and depressive symptoms of caregivers of stroke
   inpatients in China and explore the mediating effect of self-efficacy
   between sleep disorder and depressive symptoms among Chinese caregivers
   of stroke inpatients. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional
   study, a total of 305 caregivers who were hospitalized with stroke
   patients completed the PROMIS Sleep Disorder Short Form Scale, General
   Self-Efficacy Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in two general
   public hospitals in northeast and southeast China. A structural equation
   model with bootstrap method was performed to determine the mediation of
   self-efficacy between sleep disorder and depressive symptoms. Results:
   Among the participants, 55.4\% of caregivers reported depressive
   symptoms. Sleep disorder and self-efficacy were significant predictors
   of depressive symptoms. The direct impact of sleep disorder on
   depressive symptoms was positive, and the path coefficient of sleep
   disorder with depressive symptoms was decreased from 0.45 to 0.38 (P <
   0.01) after addition of self-efficacy in the model. This indicated that
   self-efficacy played as mediator. Conclusion: The caregivers of stroke
   inpatients were in poor physical and psychological health, and more than
   half of the caregivers (55.4\%) suffered from depressive symptoms. Our
   research revealed the mediation of self-efficacy between sleep disorder
   and depressive symptoms, and emphasized the importance of enhancing
   self-efficacy to reduce depressive symptoms among caregivers of stroke
   inpatients. These results demonstrate that focusing on self-efficacy
   interventions can enhance mental health and reduce depressive symptoms
   effectively.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: For family caregivers, sudden stroke events and heavy caring
   works are stressful events. At present, controversies about the factors
   affecting caregivers' stress response and their correlation with coping
   styles still exist.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore the influencing factors and coping styles of
   mental health stress responses of stroke caregivers and promote
   caregivers to adopt positive coping styles for diseases and caring
   works.
   METHODS: The convenience sampling method is used to select stroke
   caregivers as the research objects. The general information
   questionnaires, Relative Stress Scale (RSS), General Self-Efficacy Scale
   (GSES), Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), Positive and Negative Affect
   Schedule (PANAS), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) are
   utilized for investigation.
   RESULTS: 205 valid questionnaires are returned. Analysis suggests that
   the influential factors of mental health stress responses of stroke
   caregivers include the course of the disease, the impact of the disease
   on economic conditions, obligation to take care of other family members,
   understanding of stroke-associated diseases, and whether the patient is
   at risk. Social support and self-efficacy are negatively correlated with
   stress responses, while negative coping style is significantly
   positively correlated with stress responses.
   CONCLUSIONS: By increasing social support and self-efficacy, medical
   workers can guide stroke caregivers to take positive coping styles,
   thereby reducing their mental health stress responses.},

Title = {Postdischarge Intervention for Stroke Caregivers: Protocol for a
   Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: The majority of stroke survivors return to their homes and
   need assistance from family caregivers to perform activities of daily
   living. These increased demands coupled with the lack of preparedness
   for their new roles lead to a high risk for caregivers developing
   depressive symptoms and other negative outcomes. Follow-up home support
   and problem-solving interventions with caregivers are crucial for
   maintaining stroke survivors in their homes. Problem-solving
   interventions are effective but are underused in practice because they
   require large amounts of staff time to implement and are difficult for
   caregivers logistically.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to test a problem-solving
   intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered over the
   telephone during the patient's transitional care period (time when the
   stroke survivor is discharged to home) followed by 8 asynchronous online
   sessions.
   Methods: The design is a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial with
   repeated measures. We will enroll 240 caregivers from eight Veterans
   Affairs (VA) medical centers. Participants randomized into the
   intervention arm receive a modified problem-solving intervention that
   uses telephone and web-based support and training with interactive
   modules, fact sheets, and tools on the previously developed and
   nationally available Resources and Education for Stroke Caregivers'
   Understanding and Empowerment Caregiver website. In the usual care
   group, no changes are made in the information, discharge planning, or
   care the patients who have had a stroke normally receive, and caregivers
   have access to existing VA resources (eg, caregiver support line,
   self-help materials). The primary outcome is a change in caregiver
   depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection.
   Secondary outcomes include changes in stroke caregivers' burden,
   knowledge, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, perceived
   stress, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with care and
   changes in stroke survivors' functional abilities and health care use.
   The team will also determine the budgetary impact, facilitators,
   barriers, and best practices for implementing the intervention.
   Throughout all phases of the study, we will collaborate with members of
   an advisory panel.
   Results: Study enrollment began in June 2015 and is ongoing. The first
   results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021.
   Conclusions: This is the first known study to test a transitional care
   and messaging center intervention combined with technology to decrease
   caregiver depressive symptoms and to improve the recovery of stroke
   survivors. If successful, findings will support an evidence-based model
   that can be transported into clinical practice to improve the quality of
   caregiving post stroke.},

Title = {Effect of Informational Support on Anxiety in Family Caregivers of
   Patients with Hemiplegic Stroke},

Abstract = {Background: Brain stroke causes physical and mental disabilities, as
   well as dependence on one's family. In such cases, the families suffer
   from severe crisis and anxiety due to the unexpected incidence of the
   disease and unawareness of the associated consequences. Objectives: The
   aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
   informational support on the level of anxiety in family caregivers of
   hemiplegic stroke patients. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was
   performed on 78 family caregivers of hemiplegic stroke patients admitted
   to the Neurology Department of Farshchian Hospital in Hamadan, Iran,
   over 8 months. The subjects were selected through convenience sampling
   method and divided into two groups of intervention (n = 40) and control
   (n = 38). Intervention started from the third day of hospitalization and
   continued until the eleventh day. During this period, information about
   the ward, equipment, patient status, and care procedure at home, was
   provided for the intervention group individually and in groups. On the
   other hand, the control group only received the routine care. Anxiety
   level of caregivers was measured through the Spielberger scale both
   before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed in SPSS
   software (version 16). Results: Based on the results, both groups were
   similar in terms of demographic variables (P > 0.05). Moreover, there
   was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean
   level of state and trait anxiety before the intervention (P > 0.05).
   However, after intervention, the mean level of state and trait anxiety
   of the intervention group showed a significant reduction in comparison
   to that of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: According to the
   findings, it can be concluded that informational support is effective in
   reducing the state and trait anxiety in family caregivers of stroke
   patients. Therefore, it is suggested that nurses consider informational
   support as an important nursing intervention during hospitalization.},

Title = {Creating a Caregiver Benefit Finding Scale of Family Caregivers of
   Stroke Survivors: Development and Psychometric Evaluation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {In recent years, increased attention has been paid to the benefit
   finding of family caregivers due to the important role they play.
   Although some instruments measure benefit finding of caregivers, they do
   not comprehensively address it in terms specific to the family
   caregivers of stroke survivors, who require long-term, consistent care.
   This study is the first effort to develop a comprehensive Caregiver
   Benefit Finding Scale for the family caregivers of stroke survivors in a
   Chinese cultural setting. First, 50 items were extracted from a
   systematic literature review, and a semi-structured interview was
   conducted with 20 stroke family caregivers to develop the preliminary
   version of the scale (Version 1). Second, Delphi procedures with 20
   experts were used to revise the first version and create Version 2 (37
   items). Another six experts were recruited for content validation. Item
   content validity index (I-CVI) values ranged from 0.83 to 1.00, and the
   value of the scale CVI was 0.97. Third, 309 family caregivers completed
   the Version 2 questionnaire and the Chinese version of the Positive
   Aspects of Caregiving. Two weeks later, 35 family caregivers once again
   completed the questionnaires. An exploratory factor analysis produced
   four components (personal growth, health promotion, family growth, and
   self-sublimation) and 26 items for Version 3 (the cumulative proportion
   variance was 74.14\%). Subsequently, 311 family caregivers completed
   Version 3. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the structure. The
   goodness of fit index (GFI) = 0.921, adjusted GFI = 0.901, normal fit
   index = 0.951, incremental fit index = 0.990, comparative FI = 0.990,
   and the root mean square error of approximation = 0.02 were within the
   acceptable range. Criterion-related validity was equal to 0.803. The
   model-based internal consistency index was 0.845 and the values of the
   Cronbach'alpha coefficient of the four dimensions were 0.885-0.953. The
   split-half reliability was 0.92, and the test-retest reliability was
   0.994. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the validity and
   reliability of the Caregiver Benefit Finding Scale. The scale can help
   researchers and clinicians to achieve a more comprehensive understanding
   of stroke family caregivers' positive experience. This understanding is
   necessary for future efforts to address issues in benefit finding by
   targeting the underlying mechanism and intervention.},

Abstract = {Demands placed on informal caregivers can result in an increased
   likelihood of experiencing common mental health difficulties that may
   affect their ability to undertake the caring role. Currently, however,
   few evidence-based interventions have been specifically developed for
   informal caregivers and available interventions are difficult to access.
   The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme aims to
   improve access to evidence-based psychological therapies for all groups
   and may therefore present an opportunity to meet informal caregiver
   needs. Located within the MRC Complex Intervention Framework, a Phase II
   feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) examines key
   methodological, procedural and clinical uncertainties associated with
   running a definitive Phase III RCT of an adapted written cognitive
   behavioural therapy (CBT) self-help intervention for informal caregivers
   of stroke survivors. Recruitment was low despite different recruitment
   strategies being adopted, highlighting significant challenges moving
   towards a Phase III RCT until resolved. Difficulties with study
   recruitment may reflect wider challenges engaging informal caregivers in
   psychological interventions and may have implications for IAPT services
   seeking to improve access for this group. Further attempts to develop a
   successful recruitment protocol to progress to a Phase III RCT examining
   effectiveness of the adapted CBT self-help intervention should be
   encouraged.},

Abstract = {Complex public health programmes may suffer from `teething problems'
   during their implementation in practice, especially when programmes are
   developed top-down without the participation of end-users and service
   providers. Trying out and optimising a new concept in practice with
   stakeholder ` s participation may enhance the programme ` s chance of
   success. In this article we describe the participatory optimisation
   process of a German primary prevention programme for stroke caregivers,
   performed before its full-scale implementation. A Participatory Action
   Research (PAR) approach was applied immediately after the development of
   the preliminary programme that was led by the professional research
   team. Iterative PAR-cycles were composed of: observe, reflect, plan and
   act. Through PAR a matured concept, containing eight Conceptual Building
   Blocks, was obtained. The five preliminary building blocks: `Content `,
   `Human resources `, `Personalised approach `, `Timing `, and `Setting `,
   were prioritised to be the core blocks, providing the base for
   individual caregiver support. Three new building blocks: `Network
   building `, `Communication `, and `Social safety-net ` were designated
   as facilitating blocks, interconnecting and safeguarding the programme.
   PAR was found to be vital in systematically detecting the conceptual
   weaknesses of the preliminary concept and in adjusting its components to
   the needs of the key stakeholders, before full-scale implementation.},

Abstract = {Content produced by caregivers of stroke survivors on the online
   video-sharing platform YouTube may be a good source of knowledge
   regarding caregivers' unmet needs. We aimed to examine the content,
   quantity and quality of YouTube videos that target and discuss the needs
   and concerns of caregivers of stroke survivors. YouTube was
   systematically searched using six search strings, and the first 20
   videos retrieved from each search were screened against the inclusion
   criteria. A pre-determined coding schedule was used to report the rate
   of unmet needs in each video. Twenty-six videos were included in the
   analysis. In total, 291 unmet needs were reported by caregivers of
   stroke survivors, an average of 11.2 unmet needs per video. The most
   common unmet needs domain was `Impact of Caregiving on Daily Activities'
   (44\%). Most videos were developed in the United States (61.5\%) and
   featured spouses of stroke survivors (65.47\%). Content produced by
   caregivers of stroke survivors on YouTube may be used as a tool for
   caregivers to provide and receive support through online communication.
   YouTube videos offer insight into the unmet needs of caregivers of
   stroke survivors and may be used as an additional resource for stroke
   services to support caregivers.},

   the burden of care. In this cross-sectional study, we have selected 62
   informal home caregivers of the patients admitted to ``the stroke
   outpatient unit of the neurology clinic{''} of the central hospital in
   Semnan province, Iran, to take part in the investigation. We interviewed
   them using the Caregiver Burden Inventory and SF-36 Questionnaire for
   assessing their quality of life. There was a negative and significant
   correlation between different aspects of quality of life and burden of
   care. In the bivariate regression model, being married and having lower
   levels of education (minimum years of schooling) were associated with
   higher levels of the burden. Our study shows that increasing burden of
   care in informal home caregivers reduces the quality of life in all
   domains. Thus, the results of this study indicate that an increase in
   the burden of caregiving on caregivers lowers their quality of life in
   all aspects; especially, caregivers who provide care to their spouses
   encountered more burden. Therefore, these caregivers must be in the
   center of interest while planning to reduce the burden of care.},

Title = {Correlates of social support on report of probable common mental
   disorders in Zimbabwean informal caregivers of patients with stroke: a
   cross-sectional survey},

Abstract = {Objective Stroke is a major global public health burden. Unfortunately,
   stroke invariably leads to functional limitations, consequently, most
   stroke survivors are hugely dependent on family members/informal
   caregivers in carrying out essential daily activities. The increased
   demands of caregiving negatively impact caregivers' mental health.
   Nevertheless, caregivers who receive an adequate amount of social
   support are likely to adjust better to the caregiving role. We sought to
   determine the impact of social support on the mental wellbeing of 71
   caregivers of patients with stroke in Zimbabwe, a low-resourced country.
   Results The mean caregiver age was 41.5 (SD 13.8) years. Patients had a
   mean age of 65.2 (SD 15.3) years with most being functionally dependent
   (93.2\%). 45.1\% of the caregivers showed excessive psychiatric
   morbidity. The mean Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support
   (MSPSS) score was 44 (SD 9.4), denoting high levels of social support.
   Caregivers who received an adequate amount of social support were likely
   to report of lower psychiatric morbidity (Rho = - 0.285, p = 0.016).
   Furthermore, caregiver who were; poorer, were caring for more
   functionally-dependent patients, and did not receive additional
   assistance were likely to report of poor mental health functioning.
   There is therefore a strong need to implement context-specific
   caregivers wellness programs.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: Women minorities have an overall increased
   lifetime incidence of cerebrovascular disease. The provision of risk
   factor modification in this group can prove difficult. In a population
   based study. we used cluster enrollment to identify vascular risk
   factors in the female caregivers of stroke survivor study participants.
   Methods: Obese women caregivers were identified as part of Swipe out
   Stroke, a Phase I PROBE study assessing the use of SmartPhone based
   intervention for dietary modification minority stroke survivors. After
   written informed consent was obtained. both parents and caregivers were
   screened for vascular risk factors at study enrollment. Descriptive
   statistics were used to depict the study population. Continuous baseline
   variables were compared using 2 sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test
   by caregivers and patients. Categorical baseline variables were compared
   using Fisher's exact test.
   Results: Thirty-six stroke patients (63.9\% African-American, 36.1\%
   Hispanic) and thirteen female caregivers (69.2\% African-American.
   30.8\% Hispanic) were enrolled. Mean age, patients - 54.1 (SD 9.4),
   caregivers - 51.3 (SD 15.6) years, education, employment status and
   family history of stroke or obesity did not differ significantly.
   Compared to stroke patients, female caregivers were significantly less
   likely to self-report hypertension (69.2 versus 97.2\%: P = 0.01) and
   hyperlipidemia (16.7 versus 60\%: P = 0.02).
   Female caregivers were more likely to have elevated systolic blood
   pressure (147.6 vs 127.7 mmHg; P=0.05), total cholesterol (207.5 versus
   167 mg/dL; P = 0.01) and low density lipoprotein values (119.5 versus 88
   mg/dL P = 0.03) compared to stroke patients.
   Conclusions: Using cluster enrollment, we discovered minority female
   caregivers were more likely to have unknown or poorly controlled
   vascular risk factors compared to stroke patients. Innovative health
   screening tools may benefit the extended family of minority patients
   participating in clinical trials.},

Abstract = {Objectives Stroke survivors require assistance and support in their
   daily lives. This survey aims to investigate the needs and rights
   awareness in Chinese stroke survivors and caregivers in rural and urban
   settings.
   Setting This survey was adapted from the one created by the World Stroke
   Organization. The questionnaire included demands for psychological
   support, treatment and care, social support and information. From
   January 2015 to January 2016, the survey was pilot tested with urban and
   rural-dwelling stroke survivors and caregivers from 12 hospitals. Stroke
   survivors were invited to participate if they were over 18 years old and
   had experienced a stroke. Exclusion criteria were patients who had
   disorders of consciousness, significant cognitive impairment, aphasia,
   communication difficulties or psychiatric disorders. Only caregivers who
   were family members of the patients were chosen. Paid caregivers were
   excluded.
   Participants One thousand, one hundred and sixty-seven stroke survivors
   and 1119 caregivers were enrolled.
   Primary outcome measures The needs of stroke survivors and caregivers in
   rural and urban areas were compared. The correlations between needs of
   rural and urban stroke survivors and caregivers and potential effect
   factors were analysed, respectively.
   Results Among the cohort, 93.5\% reported the need for psychological
   support, 88.6\% for treatment and care, 84.8\% for information and
   62.7\% for social support. The total needs and each aspect of needs of
   stroke survivors in urban settings were greater than of those in rural
   settings (p< 0.01). In rural areas, total needs and each aspect of needs
   were positively correlated with education level (p< 0.01).
   Conclusions Needs and rights awareness of stroke survivors should also
   be recognised in both urban and rural China. According to the different
   needs of patients and their caregivers, regional and individualised
   services were needed by stroke survivors and their caregivers.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Caring fora person suffering from a chronic illness
   creates a lot of stress for the caregiver and family of the patient.
   Self-efficacy is a tool to improve health and training to the caregiver;
   promoting self-efficacy is a significant procedure in patient care and
   behavioral modification. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   effectiveness of follow-up calls by nurses on the self-efficacy of
   stroke patients'caregivers.
   Methodology: In this research, a clinical trial study was carried out
   using pre-test and post-test with the participation of 70 stroke
   patients' caregivers. They have selected through simple sampling and
   were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. Demographic
   information questionnaire and Sherer general self-efficacy scale were
   selected as tools for collecting data. Data were analyzed through
   independent t-test, paired t-test and Chi-Square using SPSS software
   version 21.
   Results: In the present study, the mean age of caregivers was 36.48 +/-
   10.44, and the majority of caregivers were patients' children. There was
   no significant difference in mean score of self-efficacy between the two
   groups before the intervention (P >= 0.05), but after the intervention,
   a significant difference (P <=.05) was observed following an increase in
   the mean score of self-efficacy in the intervention group. The
   comparison of self-efficacy score in the intervention group before and
   after the study demonstrated that the mean score of self-efficacy
   increased to 63.87 +/- 8.79 before the intervention and 68.43 +/- 7.17
   after the intervention. This increase was statistically significant (P =
   .001).
   Conclusion: According to the results of the current study, it can be
   concluded that the nurse's follow-up phone call program resulted in the
   self-efficacy of caregivers of patients suffering from stroke.},

Title = {The Effect of Educational Intervention on Family Caregivers' Perceived
   Threat of the Risk of Dependence Among Patients with Stroke: A
   Randomized Clinical Trial},
Journal = {IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Stroke is the main cause of adult inability and dependency
   on caregiver in performing activities of daily living (ADLs). Studies
   showed that the caregivers of such patients experienced high levels of
   dependency-induced caring pressure and, consequently,
   physical-psychological problems.
   Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the effect of the
   instructional intervention on family caregivers' perceived threat of
   stroke patients dependency risk.
   Methods: In a randomized controlled clinical trial study, a total of 45
   pairs of stroke patients and their family caregivers were selected based
   on inclusion and exclusion criteria and randomly divided into the
   intervention and control groups. Sampling lasted from July 2016 to March
   2017 and was performed in Tehran, Iran. Instructional intervention for
   family caregivers in the intervention group was in the form of four
   one-hour sessions. The data were collected before and immediately after
   instructional intervention at the hospital as well as two weeks and two
   months following the intervention via postal service.
   Results: The mean rank of family caregivers' perceived threat was 1.44
   and 2.76 in pre-intervention stage of intervention and control groups,
   which became 2.49 and 2.49 two months after intervention, respectively.
   The Friedman test showed that there was a significant difference in all
   post instructional intervention stages compared with pre-intervention (P
   < 0.001), whereas no such difference was observed in the control group
   (P = 0.245). The Mann-Whitney U test also showed that the
   pre-intervention family caregivers perceived threat was also not
   significantly different in the two groups (P = 0.591). However, it was
   increased immediately, two weeks, and two months following the
   intervention compared with the control group (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: It is recommended that stroke patients' caregivers be
   provided with instructional programs to enhance their understanding of
   patient dependency risks and challenges.},

Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effect of caregiver driven robot-assisted
   in-ward training in subacute stroke patients.
   Methods A retrospective evaluation was performed for patients treated
   with caregiver driven robot-assisted inward training to retain gait
   function from June 2014 and December 2016. All patients received more
   than 2 weeks of caregiver driven robot-assisted in-ward training after
   undergoing conventional programs. The robot was used as a sitting
   device, a standing frame, or a high-walker depending on functional
   status of the patient. Patients were evaluated before and after robot
   training. Patient records were assessed by Korean version of Modified
   Barthel Index (K-MBI), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and
   Functional Ambulation Category (FAC).
   Results Initially, patients used the robot as a sitting device (n=6), a
   standing frame (n=7), or a partial body-weight support high-walker
   (n=2). As patient functions were improved, usage level of the robot was
   changed to the next level. At the end of the treatment, the robot was
   used as a sitting device (n=1), a standing frame (n=6), or high-walker
   (n=8). Scores of K-MBI (Delta 17.47 +/- 10.72) and FIM (Delta 19.80 +/-
   12.34) were improved in all patients.
   Conclusion Patients' usage level of the robot and functional scores were
   improved. Therefore, performing additional caregiver driven
   robot-assisted in-ward training is feasible and beneficial for subacute
   stroke patients.},

Title = {To be or not to be? A caregiver's question: the lived experience of a
   stroke family during the first 18 months poststroke},

Abstract = {BackgroundDisability following a stroke often requires family, commonly
   a spouse, to provide care enabling the stroke survivor to return home.
   Immediate or extended family and friends may help provide direct care or
   support the primary caregiver. While family members share the common
   stroke experience, this is lived within the context of separate lives.
   Research examining the individual nuances, roles and contribution of
   family and/or friends forming part of collective stroke networks, has
   largely been overlooked.
   AimThis New Zealand study aimed to explore the lived experience of three
   stroke family members during the 18 months following a first-ever
   stroke.
   MethodHermeneutic phenomenology guided the study. Informed consent was
   obtained prior to individual interviews conducted 6 weeks, 12 months and
   18 months poststroke.
   FindingsThree main themes emerged: (i) Being prepared, (ii) Where you
   stand changes the view and (iii) Relinquishing and reclaiming. Being
   prepared revealed how these family members anticipated the stroke and
   drew on personal and professional experience in facing the phenomenon.
   The second theme showed the influence of expectation and positionality
   on family members' experiences. Relinquishing and reclaiming identified
   loss, grief and a quest for equity in the synthesis of competing stroke
   survivor and caregiver desires.
   ConclusionsFamiliarity with the caregiving role and experience of
   unreliable community services led stroke family members to question the
   primary caregiver's ability to resume caregiving following a family
   member's stroke. The primary caregiver was physically and emotionally
   spent, and rest home care for the survivor became the only
   self-preserving option. A new caring arrangement was formulated seeking
   equity for both stroke survivor and caregiver.},

   percentage of potential improvement eventually achieved with
   rehabilitation; and rehabilitation efficiency, defined as the rate of
   functional improvement during rehabilitation.
   Results: In our cohort, 96.7\% had available caregiver(s), of which
   42.0\% were primarily supported by foreign domestic workers (FDW5),
   25.9\% by spouses, 19.3\% by first-degree relatives, 7.8\% by other
   relatives, and 5.1\% by other caregivers. Using quantile regression, we
   found that having `a caregiver was independently associated with
   rehabilitation efficiency ({[}beta=-3.83; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 6.99 to 0.66; P=.018). The relationship between caregiver
   availability and rehabilitation effectiveness was modified by patient
   sex in that the negative association was significantly greater in men
   ((beta=-22.81; 95\% CI, -32.70 to -12.94; P<.001) than women (beta=
   5.64; 95\% CI, 14.72 to 3.44; P=.223). Having a FDW as a caregiver
   compared with a spousal caregiver was negatively associated with
   rehabilitation effectiveness ((3=-3.95; 95\% CI, 6.94 to 0.95; P=.01)
   and rehabilitation efficiency ((3=-1.83; 95\% CI, 3.14 to 0.53; P=.006).
   The number of potential caregivers was only significantly associated
   with rehabilitation effectiveness at the bivariate level (P=.006).
   Conclusions: Caregiver identity, and possibly availability, appears to
   negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes in subacute stroke. A better
   understanding of these relationships has potential implications on
   clinical practice and policy directions. (C) 2016 by the American

Abstract = {Objectives: This study was designed to determine the caregiver-proxy
   reliability of the Igbo-culture adapted urban version of the Maleka
   Stroke Community Reintegration Measure (I-MSCRIM).
   Methods: This was a validation study involving 74 consenting stroke
   survivors and their 74 primary informal caregivers consecutively
   recruited from selected tertiary hospitals in South-East Nigeria
   (Igboland). The I-MSCRIM was researcher-administered to the
   participants. Obtained data was analyzed using frequency counts,
   percentages, range, mean, standard deviation, Spearman rank order
   correlation, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Intra-class
   Correlation Coefficient. Alpha level was set at 0.05.
   Results: The mean ages of the stroke survivors (55.4\% males) and their
   primary informal caregivers (41.9\% males) were 50.1412.24 and 31.93 +/-
   10.9years respectively. There was no significant difference in the
   community reintegration (CR) scores as rated by stroke survivors and
   their primary informal caregivers (p>0.05). The correlations between
   stroke survivors' and primary informal caregivers' rated CR scores were
   all adequate and acceptable (ICC=0.602-0.917). The discrepancy in the
   total CR scores between the two ratings was significantly influenced by
   primary informal caregivers' educational attainment (k=13.15; p<0.01).
   Conclusion: The I-MSCRIM has acceptable caregiver-proxy reliability
   among Igbo stroke survivors in South-East Nigeria. This suggests that
   primary informal caregivers of stroke survivors can reliably estimate
   the CR of their care recipients when I-MSCRIM is administered to them.
   This will be useful when a stroke survivor cannot respond to I-MSCRIM.},

Abstract = {Background: Identifying patients' and caregivers' learning needs and
   perspectives on provided education activities is vital for the
   development of effective education in rehabilitation, yet it may not be
   deemed important. This study explored the stroke education perspectives
   in a Canadian rehabilitation centre to illustrate one approach for
   addressing this problem.
   Methods: This qualitative description study was overlaid by
   phenomenology; in-depth interviews were transcribed then analysed using
   a foundational thematic analysis approach. The concepts of reflexivity
   and credibility were employed to enhance trustworthiness.
   Findings: Three patients and three caregivers were interviewed. Conveyed
   education focuses included secondary prevention, rate of recovery,
   knowledge collection, adherence to home programmes, transition to home,
   and personal responses to caregiving. Client-centred education,
   including providing personally relevant exercises, facilitating
   interaction with other patients, and incorporating print materials,
   trial discharges, and technology, empowered patients and caregivers to
   benefit from `teachable moments'.
   Conclusions: If education programmes are to achieve expected outcomes,
   input from targeted learners about their learning needs and the
   effectiveness of received education programmes is essential. Qualitative
   description is one approach for gathering information which can yield
   valuable insights for those designing education programmes and
   contribute to improved patient-centred care and rehabilitation outcomes.},

Title = {The meaning of caregiving experience lived by Lebanese family caregivers

Abstract = {Introduction : six million of deaths are due today to stroke, while
   stroke survivors will depend on their caregivers at home.
   Background : as the literature noted in, these caregivers meet
   challenges and satisfactions, encouraging them to resort to adaptation
   strategies in order to cope with their care situation.
   Objective : the purpose of this article is to describe and understand
   the experience of Lebanese family caregivers who take care at home of a
   relative stroke survivor.
   Method : using the phenomenological approach of Giorgi (1997), twelve
   interviews were conducted with six family caregivers who have been
   recruited through a rehabilitation center in Beirut.
   Results : eight themes have emerged from the phenomenological analysis:
   the family caregiver burden, the missing social support, the learning
   through his experience of a family caregiver, the contribution to
   caregiving survivor, the selflessness in the caregiving, the gratitude
   in the caregiving, the familiarization with new routines and
   reconciliation with new lifestyle. The proposed essence from this
   phenomenological analysis is: the satisfaction in taking care of the
   stoke survivor by facing challenges and bringing order into the chaos
   caused by the stroke.
   Conclusion : the knowledge gained from this study would allow nurses to
   identify family caregivers at risk in order to help them to adapt to
   their new role as caregivers, and to develop health promotion
   strategies, taking into consideration their experience.},

Abstract = {Perception of caregiver burden among stroke survivors varies based on
   socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. The objectives of this study
   were to identify the burdens among Thai caregivers of older stroke
   survivors, characteristics of caregivers and severity of caregiver
   burden. Caregivers of older stroke survivors were randomly interviewed
   (March-June, 2012). Information on baseline characteristics and
   caregiver burden using Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI) was collected. One
   hundred one participants were assessed. The mean ZBI was 21.6 +/- 14.5
   {[}95\% CI, 18.7-24.8]. More than half of caregivers reported no burden
   (54.5\%). High burdens were associated with low self-reported income,
   high numbers of basic activities of daily living needed and coexisting
   musculoskeletal conditions. The observed low degree of burden might be
   the result of the sociocultural view of the study participants.},

Title = {Men as caregivers for their wives - Two phenomenological studies of the
   experiences of male primary caregivers in home care arrangements. Part
   I: Men as caregivers for their wives after stroke},
Journal = {PFLEGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: In Germany, men participate more and more in the extensive
   process of caring for their relatives. The ongoing discourse in nursing
   sciences, however, reflects poorly on this increasing number of male
   principal caregivers.
   Aim: Objective of the present study is to analyse the following
   questions, with focus on caring husbands: Firstly, how do caring
   husbands experience caring for their wives after stroke? And secondly,
   how do they organise daily life?
   Method: Narrative interviews with ten caring husbands were conducted.
   Analysis was performed using a modified phenomenological-interpretative
   approach as described by Diekelmann (1992).
   Results: Six central issues evolved: ``I never thought something like
   that'd happen to us ...{''} (disease as acute crisis); ``I see her just
   the way she was when we first met ...{''} (relationship); ``... since
   then I got her in home care.{''} (care); ``... this work, it's never
   been easy{''} (work and burden); ``This new situation, well, you've got
   to adapt ...{''} (adaptation); ``... because I do need some time for
   myself!{''} (support and relief). ``Being responsible{''}emerged as a
   constitutive pattern, according to which caring husbands perceive their
   own life situation.
   Conclusion: Professional nurses should take this constitutive pattern
   seriously and should align their work to it when collaborating with male
   principal care givers. For this purpose, further research is needed to
   develop new approaches to this special situation and its implications.},

Abstract = {Objective: The involvement of families in assisting health professionals
   in providing care for their family members who suffer a stroke during
   hospitalization is common in Malaysia. Family caregivers are accountable
   in providing for the first-ever stroke survivor's needs, including
   maintaining functional improvements gained in rehabilitation and the
   long-term well-being of the stroke survivors. The objective of this
   study was to determine the predictors of life satisfaction among family
   caregivers of hospitalized first-ever stroke patients. Methods: This was
   a cross-sectional community research design study with purposive
   sampling. It involved 102 family caregivers of hospitalized first-ever
   stroke patients of two tertiary hospitals in Kelantan. The Bakas
   Caregiving Outcomes Score (BCOS) was used to measure life satisfaction.
   Multiple linear regression was used to determine the predictors of life
   satisfaction. Results: Out of 102 respondents, 21 were males and 81 were
   females with age range of 16 to 76 years. Significant predictors of life
   satisfaction of caregivers while caring for their hospitalized
   first-ever stroke family members were caregivers' health (beta -2.875,
   95\% CI: -5.725, -0.025, p = 0.048), patients' age (beta -4.251, 95\%
   CI: -6.379, -2.123, p<0.001) and educational status of patients (beta
   3.176, 95\% CI: 1.083, 5.269, p = 0.003). Conclusion: This study
   highlighted predictors of life satisfaction among caregivers while
   caring for their hospitalized family members with stroke. The results
   may provide a basis for developing a support program for the family
   caregivers of hospitalized stroke patients in preparation for their
   continuing caregiving role at their homes.},

Abstract = {Background: Caregivers of patients with stroke are central in providing
   for the patient's needs post stroke. The well-being and quality of life
   of the caregiver is important in the rehabilitation of the patient with
   stroke. This study sought to establish the: functional level of
   patients, level of strain and quality of life of the caregiver, and the
   factors that influence caregivers' quality of life six to 36 months post
   stroke.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study which included 35 patients six
   to 36 months post stroke and their primary caregiver utilising a sample
   of convenience from local clinics/hospitals in Johannesburg. Demographic
   information was obtained from the patient and the caregiver using a
   questionnaire. The Barthel Index (BI), Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) and
   the EQ-5D were also administered.
   Results: On the BI, 60\% of the patients were moderately dependent to
   independent while 77\% of the caregivers were strained. Older caregivers
   were 81\% more likely to experience a decrease in quality of life than
   younger caregivers.
   Conclusion: A large proportion of patients are discharged from hospital
   without receving rehabilitation and are still dependent on caregivers
   six to 36 months post stroke. Caregivers of patients with stroke need
   more support from health professionals to mitigate against the high
   strain and low quality of life that they experience when caring for
   patients six to 36 months post stroke.},

Abstract = {Reliability of caregivers in assessing the quality of life of stroke
   survivors: an explorative study. Introduction. Not all stroke survivors
   are able to assess their quality of life (QOL), thus a caregiver could
   provide important information on patients' QOL. Objective. To assess
   caregiver's reliability in measuring QOL in stroke survivors. Method.
   Fifty (50) patient-caregiver dyads were recruited. Patients,
   hospitalized in rehabilitation facilities, were administered the Stroke
   Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS 3.0) patient version, the Barthel Index, the
   Modified Rankin Scale, and the National Institute of Health Stroke
   Scale. Caregivers completed the SIS 3.0 proxy version. Results. The mean
   scores of the SIS 3.0 patient version were very similar to the proxy
   version and ranged from 19.1 vs 16.2 for the Hand function domain to
   83.81 vs 81.85 for the Communication domain. Caregivers tended to
   underestimate patients' QOL although scores were not significantly
   different. Intraclass correlations between the patient version and the
   proxy version of the SIS 3.0 were highly significant (p<0.001), with
   coefficient over 0.80. Lower coefficients were observed for the Social
   participation (0.58), Emotion (0.64) and Communication (0.79) domains.
   Conclusions. Caregivers were more reliable in assessing the physical
   rather than psychosocial domains.},

Title = {Family caregivers' perceptions of hospital-based allied health services
   post-stroke: Use of the Measure of Processes of Care to investigate
   processes of care},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Aim:
   To investigate family caregiver perceptions of allied health
   professional processes of care and support in hospital following stroke,
   and to test an adapted version of the Measure of Processes of Care
   (MPOC) for its suitability of use in the stroke care setting.
   Methods:
   The first stage involved the adaptation and refinement of the MPOC,
   designed to measure caregiver perceptions of processes of professional
   care and support across five care dimensions. The second stage involved
   mailing out of questionnaires to primary caregivers of stroke survivors.
   A total of 107 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis.
   The reliability of the adapted questionnaire was assessed and summary
   statistics were computed.
   Results:
   The reliability of the adapted MPOC was found to be high, with good
   internal consistency of items within each subscale. Mean scores
   indicated that caregivers were most likely to report negative
   perceptions of the way allied health professionals engaged with and
   supported them, particularly in the area of information provision.
   Conclusion:
   The number of families being affected by stroke is predicted to rise
   substantially in the near future. Allied health professionals have a
   significant role to play in supporting family caregivers. Results
   highlight caregiver-identified areas of weakness in current clinical
   practice.},

Abstract = {Caregiver education program has been applied to stroke patients, while
   its effect on mental health in stroke patients is still obscure. This
   study aimed to assess the impact of the WeChat-based caregiver education
   (WBCE) program on cognition, anxiety, and depression in stroke patients.
   Totally, 170 patients with ischemic stroke were included. They were
   randomized at a 1:1 ratio to the WBCE group (N = 86) and control care
   (CC) group (N = 84), and their caregivers received WBCE or CC for 12
   months, respectively. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was
   increased in the WBCE group compared with that in the CC group at the
   9(th) month (M9) (27.2 +/- 1.9 vs 26.6 +/- 1.6, P = 0.017) and M12 (27.1
   +/- 1.8 vs 26.5 +/- 1.5, P = 0.015), while cognitive impairment rate was
   decreased in WBCE group compared with that in CC group at 12(th) month
   (M12) (30.2\% vs 45.2\%, P=0.043). In the meantime, the Hospital Anxiety
   and Depression Scale (HADS) for Anxiety score (6.5 +/- 3.1 vs 7.5 +/-
   2.8, P = 0.020), HADS for depression score (6.7 +/- 3.1 vs 7.7 +/- 3.3,
   P = 0.040) and depression rate (33.7\% vs 48.8\%, P = 0.046) in WBCE
   group were reduced compared with those in CC group at M12. Besides, an
   elevation in the satisfaction score of patients at M12 (8.0 +/- 1.2 vs
   7.4 +/- 1.2, P = 0.002) and that of caregivers at 6(th) months (M6) (6.6
   +/- 1.1 vs 6.2 +/- 1.3, P = 0.038) and M12 (7.2 +/- 1.1 vs 6.8 +/- 1.4,
   P=0.042) were found in WBCE group compared with CC group. WBCE program
   not only improves the satisfaction of stroke patients and caregivers but
   also attenuates cognitive impairment and depression in stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Objectives The primary objective was to gain insight into the lived
   experiences of using day-to-day strategies to manage post-stroke
   fatigue. Design Qualitative, descriptive study. Setting Community
   telephone interviews. Participants A purposive sample of 20 stroke
   survivors with current, or previous, post-stroke fatigue, and 8
   caregivers, who provided informal care or support, were recruited. Main
   Measures Semi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken. Data were
   analysed using a framework approach. Results Most participants had found
   their own ways of coping and their personal strategies included
   acceptance of having fatigue; `pacing' (spreading activities out and
   interspersing with rest periods); keeping a diary in order to plan
   activities and to identify `trigger' activities which induced fatigue;
   talking to (and educating) others about having fatigue; using
   relaxation; and accessing professional advice and support. The burden
   placed on caregivers was considerable and they often had to oversee the
   post-stroke fatigue management strategies used. Conclusions Post-stroke
   fatigue is managed in different ways and there was not one particular
   strategy that seemed effective for everyone. Most people in our study
   had had to devise their own ways of coping practically. Given the scale
   of this problem, which profoundly impacts the lives of both stroke
   survivors and caregivers, the management of post-stroke fatigue merits
   more attention and evaluation. However, this must be directly informed
   by those with lived experience.},

Title = {The experience of stroke survivors and caregivers during
   hospital-to-home transitional care: A qualitative longitudinal study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors and their caregivers experience different
   difficulties that arise from certain physical, psychological, social
   aspects and caring burdens during the hospital-to-home transitional
   period. Although there are abundant studies that focus on stroke
   transitional care, there are limited qualitative studies that synthesize
   the experience of hospital-to-home transitional care for stroke
   survivors and their caregivers in China.Objective: To evaluate the
   experience of stroke survivors and their family caregivers during
   hospital-to home transitional care in China.Methods: A qualitative
   longitudinal study based on semi-structured interviews were implemented
   to address the research objective. Interviews were conducted at two
   stages, (1) when stroke survivors were close to discharge, and (2)
   within two months post-discharge. Participants were recruited from one
   tertiary hospital between April and September 2019. Data were analyzed
   using reflexive thematic analysis.Findings: Twenty-three stroke
   survivor/caregiver dyads participated, totaling 92 individual
   interviews. The thematic framework based on the experience of stroke
   survivors and caregivers reveals a three-phases of the hospital-to-home
   trajectory: survived, living in the mist, and crisis at home. The study
   identified one key theme (the optimism and hope) in the first phase,
   four key themes in the second (the pre-discharge emotional concerns and
   reactions, lack of stroke knowledge and stroke care information,
   difficulties of performing home-based healthcare, expectation of
   hospital pre-discharge) and in the third phase (high level of
   post-discharge stress, inaccessible postdischarge care services and
   health resources, interpersonal relationship disruption and lifestyle
   changes, financial burdens) respectively. In addition, several
   interconnected subthemes for stroke survivors' and caregivers'
   experiences were identified in each phase.Conclusion: The experience of
   stroke survivors and caregivers during hospital-to-home transitional
   care is a dynamic process with enormous challenges in each phase. These
   findings have implications for policy makers and health care systems
   regarding developing an enabling environment that supports successful
   hospital-to-home transitional care. Collaboration with health care
   professionals, accessible rehabilitation services and follow-up support
   after discharge, and available community and social support are
   warranted to be integrated into transitional care to help stroke
   survivors and caregivers to facilitate their hospital-to-home
   trajectory.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background Studies have found that caregivers can influence stroke
   survivors' outcomes, such as mortality. It is thus pertinent to identify
   significant factors associated with caregivers' outcomes. The study
   objective was to examine the associations between caregivers'
   psychosocial characteristics and caregivers' depressive symptoms.
   Methods The analysis obtained three-month and one-year post-stroke data
   from the Singapore Stroke Study, which was collected from hospital
   settings. Caregivers' depressive symptoms were assessed via the Center
   for Epidemiologic Studies Depression instrument. Psychosocial
   characteristics of caregivers included subjective burden (Zarit Burden
   Interview), quality of care-relationship (a modified 3-item scale from
   the University of Southern California Longitudinal Study of
   Three-Generation Families) and expressive social support (an 8-item
   scale from Pearlin et al.). Mixed effect Tobit regressions were used to
   examine the associations between these study variables. Results A total
   of 214 caregivers of stroke patients hospitalized were included in the
   final analysis. Most caregivers were Chinese women with secondary school
   education, unemployed and married to the patients. Caregivers'
   subjective burden was positively associated with their depressive
   symptoms (Partial regression coefficient: 0.18, 95\% CI 0.11-0.24).
   Quality of care-relationship (Partial regression coefficient: - 0.35,
   95\% CI - 0.63 to - 0.06) and expressive social support (partial
   regression coefficient: - 0.28, 95\% CI - 0.37 to - 0.19) were
   negatively associated with caregivers' depressive symptoms. Caregivers'
   depressive symptoms were higher at three-month post-stroke than one-year
   post-stroke (Partial regression coefficient: - 1.00, 95\% CI - 1.80 to -
   0.20). Conclusion The study identified subjective burden, quality of
   care-relationship and expressive social support as significantly
   associated with caregivers' depressive symptoms. Caregivers'
   communication skills may also play a role in reducing caregivers'
   depressive symptoms.},

Title = {Neurorehabilitation through Hippotherapy on Neurofunctional Sequels of
   Stroke: Effect on Patients' Functional Independence,

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a high burden illness and the second leading cause
   of worldwide disability with generally poor recovery rates. Robust
   benefits of hippotherapy, a novel neurorehabilitation approach, in
   functional recovery following various severe neurological disabling
   conditions has been shown. In the present study, we will analyze the
   effect of a hippotherapy program on the outcome of post-stroke patients
   in the first year post-stroke. Method: A randomized controlled clinical
   trial on the effectiveness of hippotherapy (4 weeks/18 weeks
   hippotherapy/conventional neurorehabilitation) versus conventional
   neurorehabilitation alone (22 weeks) will be conducted over 48 weeks. In
   the treated group, one-hour daily hippotherapy sessions will be
   exclusively conducted during the hippotherapy's cycles, alternated with
   periods of conventional neurorehabilitation. A test battery will measure
   both the functional and psychological outcomes. The primary endpoint
   will be the patient's functional independence. The secondary endpoints
   will measure the sensorimotor function, autonomy, and quality of life,
   as well as the caregivers' quality of life. Results and conclusion:
   Individual brain connectome, life history and personality construct
   influence the brain's functional connectivity and are central to
   developing optimal tailored neurorehabilitation strategies. According to
   our current practice, hippotherapy allows the enhancement of substantial
   neuroplastic changes in the injured brain with significant neurological
   recovery. The protocol aims to confirm those issues. Trial registration

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to incorporate a
   person-centered approach to understand the emotional health needs and
   perspectives of stroke survivors (SSs) and their caregivers. METHODS: In
   collaboration with 4 SSs and caregivers as research partners,
   quantitative data were collected to assess poststroke emotional health
   needs, and qualitative data were collected to gain insight into SS and
   caregiver emotional health perspectives after stroke. RESULTS: Forty
   surveys (n = 26 SSs, n = 14 caregivers) were collected. The predominate
   emotional health needs were frustration (65\%), anxiety (54\%), and
   stress (50\%) for SSs and stress (71\%), worry (57\%), and frustration
   (57\%) for caregivers. Two group interviews (n = 7 SSs, n = 3
   caregivers) were completed. Four emerging themes were identified:
   receiving support from those in similar situations, poststroke emotional
   responses, situations experienced in healthcare settings, and a
   hypervigilance for sudden and unexpected events. CONCLUSION: Emotional
   healthcare services for SSs and their caregivers may consider providing
   reoccurring mental health education and multifaceted treatment
   approaches, including provision of peer support, and addressing the
   unique emotional stressors SSs and caregivers may be experiencing. The
   small sample size precludes generalizing the results into the broader
   stroke population. However, by leveraging the lived experience of SSs
   and their caregivers, the results may help find ways to support SSs' and
   caregivers' emotional health.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Stroke is the leading cause of adult lifelong disability worldwide. A
   stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease with a variety of causes and
   corresponding clinical symptoms. Around 75\% of surviving stroke
   patients experience impaired nerve function, and some suffer from
   traumatic fractures, which can lead to special care needs.
   AIM
   To determine the effect of timing theory continuous care, with
   resistance training, on the rehabilitation and mental health of
   caregivers and stroke patients with traumatic fractures.
   METHODS
   Between January 2017 to March 2021, we selected 100 hospital admissions
   with post-stroke hemiplegia complicated with a traumatic fracture. Two
   participant groups were created: (1) Control group: given resistance
   training; and (2) Observation group: given timing theory continuous care
   combined with resistance training. The degree of satisfaction and
   differences in bone and phosphorus metabolism indexes between the two
   groups were compared. The self-perceived burden scale (SPBS) and
   caregiver burden questionnaire were used to evaluate the psychological
   health of patients and caregivers. The Harris hip function score,
   ability of daily living (ADL) scale, and global quality of life
   questionnaire (GQOL-74) were used to evaluate hip function, ability of
   daily living, and quality of life.
   RESULTS
   Data were collected prior to and after intervention. Alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, and vitamin D3 in the observation group
   and control group increased after intervention (P < 0.05), and
   carboxy-terminal peptide of type I collagen beta Special sequence
   (beta-CTX) decreased (P < 0.05). ALP and osteocalcin in the observation
   group were higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no
   significant difference in beta-CTX and vitamin D3 between the two groups
   (P > 0.05). The SPBS score of the observation group was lower and the
   ADL score was higher than the control group. The burden score was lower
   and the Harris hip function and GQOL-74 scores were higher than that of
   the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group's satisfaction
   rating was 94.00\%, which was higher than the rating from the control
   group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION
   Timing theory continuous nursing with resistance training can reduce hip
   dysfunction in stroke patients with a traumatic fracture and enhance
   quality of life and mental health of patients and caregivers.},

Title = {Needs of family members caring for stroke survivors in china: A
   deductive qualitative content analysis study by using the caregiver task
   inventory-25},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},

Abstract = {Background In China, family caregivers are usually the main carers of
   relatives after stroke due to traditional Chinese culture and the
   limited development of the primary healthcare system. This
   responsibility often results in burdens and negative health outcomes.
   However, family caregivers seldom receive support. To improve informal
   care, as well as the health and well-being of family caregivers, it is
   important to identify their needs. Objective This study aimed to
   deductively explore the needs of family members caring for stroke
   survivors in China. Methods Twenty-six semi-structured interviews were
   performed with family caregivers of stroke survivors who were selected
   from one city and three communities by purposive sampling. A deductive
   qualitative content analysis method was performed by using the Caregiver
   Task Inventory-25 (CTI-25), an instrument measuring the needs of family
   caregivers, as a framework. Results All subscales, as well as all
   belonging items in the CTI-25, were identified in the present study,
   meaning that the family caregivers had needs related to learning to cope
   with new role, providing care according to care-receiver's needs,
   managing own emotional needs, appraising supportive resources, and
   balancing caregiving needs and one's own needs. Moreover, needs related
   to financial support, both direct and indirect, were identified but not
   part of the CTI-25. Conclusion These findings identified that family
   caregivers of stroke survivors in China had various needs, which is
   important knowledge when assessing needs and improving health care for
   family caregivers. Cultural adjustments and modifications should be made
   if CTI-25 is used in mainland China. This study also indicated a
   comprehensive and holistic perspective (individual, community, and
   social level) when identifying, assessing needs or implementing
   interventions to support family caregivers.},

Title = {The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on emotional and behavioral

Abstract = {Introduction Even in nonpandemic times, persons with disabilities
   experience emotional and behavioral disturbances which are distressing
   for them and for their close persons. We aimed at comparing the levels
   of stress in emotional and behavioral aspects, before and during
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as reported by informal family
   caregivers of individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) or
   stroke living in the community, considering two different
   stratifications of the recipients of care (cause and injury severity).
   Methods We conducted a STROBE-compliant prospective observational study
   analyzing informal caregivers of individuals with stroke (IC-STROKE) or
   traumatic brain injury (IC-TBI). IC-STROKE and IC-TBI were assessed
   in-person before and during COVID-19 online, using the Head Injury
   Behavior Scale (HIBS). The HIBS comprises behavioral and emotional
   subtotals (10 items each) and a total-HIBS. Comparisons were performed
   using the McNemar's test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test or t-test.
   Recipients of care were stratified according to their injury severity
   using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the
   Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Results One hundred twenty-two informal
   caregivers (62.3\% IC-STROKE and 37.7\% IC-TBI) were assessed online
   between June 2020 and April 2021 and compared to their own assessments
   performed in-person 1.74 +/- 0.88 years before the COVID-19 lockdown.
   IC-STROKE significantly increased their level of stress during COVID-19
   in five emotional items (impatience, frequent complaining, often
   disputes topics, mood change and overly sensitive) and in one behavioral
   item (overly dependent). IC-TBI stress level only increased in one
   behavioral item (impulsivity). By injury severity, (i) mild (14.7\%)
   showed no significant differences in emotional and behavioral either
   total-HIBS (ii) moderate (28.7\%) showed significant emotional
   differences in two items (frequent complaining and mood change) and
   (iii) severe (56.6\%) showed significant differences in emotional (often
   disputes topics) and behavioral (impulsivity) items. Conclusions Our
   results suggest specific items in which informal caregivers could be
   supported considering cause or severity of the recipients of care.},

Title = {Examining the Influence of Social Interactions and Community Resources
   on Caregivers' Burden in Stroke Settings: A Prospective Cohort Study},

Abstract = {Since the introduction of the integrated care model, understanding how
   social interactions and community resources can alleviate caregivers'
   burden is vital to minimizing negative patients' outcomes. This study (n
   = 214) examined the associations between these factors and caregivers'
   burden in stroke settings. It used 3-month and 1-year post-stroke data
   collected from five tertiary hospitals. Subjective and objective
   caregivers' burdens were measured using Zarit burden interview and
   Oberst caregiving burden scale respectively. The independent variables
   examined were quality of care relationship, care management strategies
   for managing patients' behaviour, family caregiving conflict, formal
   service usage and assistance to the caregiver. Significant associations
   were determined using mixed effect modified Poisson regressions. For
   both types of burden, the scores were slightly higher at 3 months as
   compared to 1 year. Poorer care-relationship (relative risk: 0.81, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.94) and adopting positive care
   management strategies (relative risk: 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.07) were
   independently associated with a high subjective burden. Providing
   assistance to caregivers (relative risk: 2.45, 95\% CI: 1.72-3.29) and
   adopting positive care management strategies (relative risk: 1.03, 95\%
   CI: 1.02-1.04) were independently associated with a high objective
   burden. Adopting positive care management strategies at 3 months had a
   significant indirect effect (standardised beta: 0.11, 95\% CI: 0.01 to
   0.20) on high objective burden at one year. Healthcare providers should
   be aware that excessive care management strategies and assistance from
   family members may add to caregivers' burden.},

Title = {Seeking healthcare services post-stroke: a qualitative descriptive study
   exploring family caregiver and stroke survivor perspectives in an asian
   setting},
Journal = {BMC NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Aim Exploration of the healthcare journey post-stroke is incomplete
   without acknowledging the crucial role of family caregivers. With
   limited literature documenting the role of caregivers in the healthcare
   journey post-stroke, we aimed to describe the healthcare experiences of
   family caregivers and stroke survivors across different caregiver
   identities in Singapore. Methods We conducted a qualitative descriptive
   study involving semi-structured interviews with transcripts analysed
   using thematic analysis. 26 stroke survivors and 35 family caregivers
   purposively sampled from multiple settings. Results Findings were
   summarized into seeking care and experience of healthcare encounters.
   Seeking care comprised of the following themes: factors influencing
   seeking care, decision to seek care and role of caregiver in seeking
   care. Experience of healthcare encounters comprised of the following
   themes: service around the patient, service with care and role of
   caregiver in healthcare encounters. Conclusion Multi-dimensional role of
   caregivers in healthcare experience emerged as a major finding. Unique
   to our Asian context, as per the participants' accounts, family
   caregivers seemed to be central in healthcare decision-making for stroke
   survivors, with adult-child caregivers commonly reported being engaged
   in collaborative decision-making. While spousal caregivers preferred a
   relational healthcare experience, adult-child caregivers preferred a
   transactional one. Practical implications include equipping caregivers
   with skillset to make healthcare decisions, provision of supportive
   decision-making environment for caregivers and reinforcing communication
   aspects in the medical, nursing and allied healthcare curriculum to
   improve healthcare experience.},

Abstract = {Background Caregiving is a global phenomenon which is bound to increase
   in tandem with the aging population worldwide. Stroke is a condition
   common in older people that requires complex caregiving necessitating
   provision of adequate support to the caregivers. Past literature
   consists of limited accounts of types and organization of support
   arrangements needed by different caregivers. We aimed to describe the
   support system of caregivers of stroke survivors in Singapore,
   highlighting differences across the different caregiver identities (i.e.
   spouse, adult-child, etc.). Methods We conducted a qualitative
   descriptive study in the community setting involving 61 purposively
   sampled and recruited stroke survivors and caregivers. Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted, and transcripts were analysed using thematic
   analysis. Results Our findings were summarized across the following 4
   themes: 1) cultural influence and caregiving; 2) caregiver support
   system with the following sub-themes: 2.1) dyadic caregiver support
   type, 2.2) extended caregiver support type, 2.3.) distributed caregiver
   support type and 2.4) empowering caregiver support type; 3) breaks in
   care of stroke survivor and 4) complex relationship dynamics. We
   operationalized the caregiver support system as comprising of type,
   people and activities that enable the caregiver to participate in
   caregiving activities sustainably. While spouse caregivers preferred
   dyadic and extended support systems positioning themselves in a more
   central caregiving role, adult-child caregivers preferred distributed
   support system involving family members with paid caregivers playing a
   more central role. Conclusions Our findings highlight caregiver identity
   as a surrogate for the differences in the caregiver support systems.
   Practical implications include imparting relationship-building skills to
   the stroke survivor-caregiver dyads to sustain dyadic support system and
   educating clinicians to include differences in caregiving arrangements
   of stroke survivors in practising family-centred care.},

Abstract = {Objectives Stroke is a significant global public health challenge
   attributable to an array of disabilities it causes alongside an
   impairment in cognition. The monetary impact of stroke care includes
   acute treatment expenses as well as outrageous expenses of postdischarge
   chronic hospital care and rehabilitation services. The current study
   aimed to study the perceptions along with experiences of stroke
   survivors and caregivers.
   Materials and Methods In-depth interviews (ID's) of stroke survivors and
   their primary caregivers were conducted at their home 2 months after
   their discharge from the hospital in Bhopal, India. These IDls were
   later analyzed.
   Results The following eight themes emerged: pervasive and irreversible,
   multifunction loss and dependency, holistic impact on the health of
   person and family, money and matter, nonaccommodative cost and baffled
   belief, professional paralysis, social crisis, and slow and obscured
   progress. The added obligation of taking care of a disabled stroke
   survivor along with adjusting their own lifestyle with financial
   apprehensions, worry about future, prolonged hours of care, and stress
   are major factors that increase the burden of the caregivers.
   Conclusion Caregivers should be sensitized with proper counseling and
   training through health care institutions to ensure appropriate care and
   management of stroke survivors at home, as it will also help in
   addressing their psychosocial needs, and minimizing the knowledge gap,
   doubts and uncertainties about the disease and its aftereffects.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Stroke constitutes a significant public health problem in
   developing countries. Caregivers provide an important support system for
   patient care but usually lack knowledge and skill to attend their stroke
   patients. We assessed whether a caregiverdirected educational
   intervention would reduce hospital-acquired complications and improve
   stroke patients' outcomes. Materials and methods: We randomly assigned
   two Neurology inpatient wards to receive either standard care or an
   educational intervention. The coprimary outcomes included incidence of
   hospital-acquired complications and inhospital mortality. Secondary
   outcomes included the modified Rankin Scale and mortality at three
   months. Results: Among 164 patients recruited, 82 received intervention,
   and standard care each. The mean (Standard deviation) Glasgow coma scale
   of patients was 11.01 (3.4), and National Institute of Health Stroke
   Scale was 19.17 (8.54). The incidence of complications (72 in the
   intervention versus 81 in the control group; p=0.56) was not different.
   Ten patients (12.2\%) in the intervention group and 16 (19.5\%) in the
   control group (p=0.20) died in-hospital. Twenty patients (27.8\%) in the
   intervention and twelve (18.2\%) in the control group attained modified
   Rankin Scale 0-2 at three months (p=0.12). The mortality at three months
   (20 {[}24.4\%] in the intervention versus 25 {[}30.5\%] in the control
   group) was not different (p=0.38). The intervention group had fewer
   complications (42 versus 68 in the control group; p=0.01) during the
   initial ten days of hospital stay, but adjusted analysis revealed no
   difference. Conclusion: A structured educational intervention did not
   reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired complications, mortality, or
   morbidity. However, there was a trend towards fewer complications in the
   initial days of hospital stay. Extended hospital stay, caregiver
   fatigue, and dilution of the intervention over time might be reasons for
   the apparent lack of effect. Clinical trial registration-URL:

Title = {Empowerment in Chinese primary caregivers of post-stroke patients with
   disability A cross-sectional study},
Journal = {MEDICINE},

Abstract = {To investigate the status quo of empowerment ability of primary
   caregivers in post-stroke patients with disability and its influencing
   factors. A cross-sectional design and a convenience sample were used.
   Participants (N = 189) from 3 hospital in Beijing were recruited from
   October 2018 to June 2019. The following measurement tools were used in
   this study: Barthel index, Main Caregiver Empowerment Measurement,
   General Self-Efficacy Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and
   Social Support Rating Scale. Multiple linear stepwise regression
   analysis was used to statistically infer the influencing factors of
   empowerment ability of primary caregivers. The total score of main
   caregivers' empowerment measurement among the participants was 161.03
   +/- 14.678, the median (interquartile range) score was 162.00
   (150.00-171.50). The average scores of each dimension ranged from high
   to low: relationship with the person being cared for, goodwill care,
   expectation for care outcomes, subjectivity of caregiver, faith in care,
   understanding of care role, knowledge and skills of care, scruples about
   the surroundings, personal resources. The single factor analysis showed
   that the patient's payment method for medical expenses, whether the
   patient accompanied by other chronic diseases and the gender of the
   caregiver had an effect on the empowerment ability of primary
   caregivers, and the positive coping style, negative coping style,
   self-efficacy and subjective support of primary caregivers were
   positively correlated with their empowerment ability (P < .05). Multiple
   linear stepwise regression analysis showed that the type of payment for
   treatment of patients (b = 7.449, P < .01), and gender of caregivers (b
   = 5.039, P < .05), subjective support of caregivers (b = 0.439, P <
   .05), positive coping style of caregivers (b = 0.585, P < .01),
   self-efficacy of caregivers (b = 6.456, P < .01) were the main
   influencing factors of empowerment ability of primary caregivers. The
   empowerment ability of the primary caregivers of post-stroke patients
   with disability in China is at the upper middle level. However, there
   are more scruples about the surrounding and less personal resources,
   which deserve attention. Furthermore, the identification of the factors
   related to empowerment lays a foundation for clinical nursing
   practitioners to further develop targeted interventions on empowerment
   of caregivers.},

Abstract = {This study intended to discover the effect of education and muscle
   relaxation (EMR) program on anxiety, depression and care burden among
   caregivers of acute stroke survivors. This randomized, controlled study
   enrolled a total of 110 caregivers of first-ever acute stroke patients,
   and randomly assigned to EMR (N = 55) and control (N = 55) groups. The
   caregivers in the EMR group received 12-month health education and
   progressive muscle relaxation, and those in control group were provided
   common rehabilitation advices. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
   (HADS) and Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale in caregivers were evaluated at
   the time of patients' discharge from hospital (M0), then at month(M) 3,
   M6 and M12 after the discharge. HADS-anxiety score, anxiety rate and
   severity were similar at M0, M3, while were reduced at M6 and M12 in EMR
   group compared to control group. Furthermore, HADS-depression score was
   similar at M0 and M3 but was decreased at M6 and M12 in EMR group
   compared with control group, however, there was no difference of
   depression rate and severity between the 2 groups at each time point.
   Moreover, Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale score was similar at M0 and M3,
   but was decreased at M6 and M12; meanwhile, degree of care burden was
   similar at M0, M3 and M6, but was reduced at M12 in EMR group compared
   to control group. EMR program decreases anxiety, depression and care
   burden in caregivers of acute stroke survivors, suggesting its potential
   in improving mental health and further promoting quality of lives in
   these caregivers.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a global health problem. Patients with stroke may
   be damaged in many aspects of life, which affects the physical,
   psychological and social dimensions of quality of life. These factors
   lead to burden on the caregivers. This burden on the caregivers
   negatively affects the rehabilitation of the stroke patients.
   Objective: To study the quality of life of stroke patients and burden on
   caregivers.
   Methods: Stroke patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assessed
   for the quality of life by the Stroke Specific Quality Of Life Scale and
   the burden on caregivers was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview
   on one to one interview basis. The data were analysed using the SPSS
   software.
   Results: The quality of life and burden scores were weakly correlated
   (r= -0.558 and p= 0.001). The quality of life and burden scores were
   also weakly correlated to the MMSE scores.
   Conclusion: There is a negative correlation of the burden on caregivers
   with the quality of life of the stroke patients. There is also a
   positive correlation of MMSE score with the quality of life. Whereas,
   there is no correlation of the quality of life and burden scores with
   the patient's age and sex, type of stroke, duration post stroke and
   whether any treatment has been taken.},

Abstract = {Grit is defined as perseverance and long-term focus on goals. Grit may
   be helpful in surviving stroke for both survivors and caregivers. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the level of grit among
   survivors of stroke and caregivers using health humanities to gain a
   deeper understanding of the lived experience of stroke survivors. A
   sample of convenience was used. Phase I (n = 22) utilized the Grit Scale
   survey. Phase II (n = 6) utilized phenomenological interviews. The Grit
   Scale survey data were analyzed with SPSS 25. Qualitative data were
   analyzed with the whole-parts-whole method of Giorgi, Dahlberg, Drew,
   and Nystrom. Grit scores were high for both survivors of stroke (3.77
   +/- 0.50) and caregivers (3.89 +/- 0.51). Themes emerging from the
   phenomenological interviews included: (a) gritty toughness, (b)
   challenges, (3) accomplishments, and (4) advice for health-care
   providers. Survivors of stroke and caregivers embodied high grit levels.
   Participants articulated the importance of long-term goals despite
   challenges. Understanding grit among survivors and caregivers may help
   clinicians develop best practices to better support these individuals.},

Title = {Family Caregiver's Positive, Negative, and Ambivalent Feelings Towards
   Stroke Survivors: Association with Psychological Well-Being},

Abstract = {Ambivalence is the simultaneous experience of positive and negative
   feelings toward a specific person. Recent research suggested ambivalence
   is negatively associated with psychological well-being, and this
   association was mainly driven by negative feelings and not affected by
   the presence of positive feelings. This paper questioned the assumption
   and aimed to examine the relationship between caregiving ambivalence and
   psychological well-being, by disaggregating the positive and negative
   components of ambivalence. The study comprised data from a
   cross-sectional questionnaire survey with 190 family caregivers of
   stroke survivors (56 +/- 14.3 years old; 70\% female) in Hong Kong. The
   positive feelings and negative feelings towards a care recipient were
   separately measured, and these two composite scores were used to create
   an indirect measure of ambivalence. Psychological well-being was
   measured by caregivers' positive role appraisals and depressive
   symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that the positive
   feeling was associated with positive aspects of caregiving (beta = 0.54,
   p < 0.001) whereas negative feeling was associated with depressive
   symptoms (beta = 0.61, p < 0.001). There was no positive X negative
   interaction on depressive symptoms and positive aspects of caregiving.
   The indirect measure of ambivalence only associated with depressive
   symptoms (beta = 0.75, p < 0.001). Findings indicate the association
   between caregiving ambivalence and psychological well-being is varied by
   dominating valence as well as the method to combine the effects of
   positive and negative feelings. The positive and negative feelings
   associated with corresponding dimensions of psychological well-being but
   not to the opposite-valence outcomes. The indirect measure of
   ambivalence mainly reflects its negative component.},

Title = {Long-term follow-up of patients undergoing decompressive hemicraniectomy

   real-world setting},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Decompressive hemicraniectomy is a life-saving
   procedure for the treatment of spaceoccupying middle cerebral artery
   infarctions (malignant stroke); however, patients may survive severely
   disabled. Comprehensive data on long-term sequelae outside randomized
   controlled trials are scarce.
   Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the survival rates, quality of
   life, ability to perform activities of daily living, and caregiver
   burden of 61 patients (aged from 37 to 83) who had previously undergone
   decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant stroke between 2012 and
   2017.
   Results: The mortality rate was higher among patients older than 60
   years than among younger patients (71.0 \% vs 36.7 \%, p = 0.007; odds
   ratio 4.222, 95 \% confidence interval 1.443-12.355). The mean survival
   time was 37.9 +/- 6.0 months for 19 survivors of the younger group and
   22.6 +/- 5.7 months for 9 survivors of the older group. Among the 28
   surviving patients, 22 (78.6 \%) were interviewed, and we found that age
   was a determining factor for functional outcome (Barthel indices of 65.7
   +/- 10.6 for younger patients vs 48.0 +/- 9.3 for older patients, p <
   0.001), but not for quality of life. The caregiver burden was
   significantly correlated (R = -0.53, p < 0.01) with the severity of
   disability and age (R = 0.544, p = 0.011) of the patients.
   Conclusion: Our findings show that the degree of impairment, as well as
   caregiver burden, is higher in patients older than 60 years than in
   younger patients.},

Abstract = {Purpose: A strong interpersonal relationship after stroke is important
   for the prevention of depression in survivors and family caregivers.
   This study aimed to test the feasibility of quality of relationship
   intervention for stroke dyads calledHand in Hand(HiH). Methods: Sixteen
   dyads were randomized into either the HiH group (n= 8) or information,
   support, and referral (ISR) control group (n= 8). HiH dyads received up
   to eight sessions, with topics prioritized according to a 17-item
   screening tool. ISR dyads received up to eight sessions that included
   information, active listening, and referrals. Feasibility,
   acceptability, and outcomes data were collected for both groups.
   Results: The HiH and ISR groups were feasible and acceptable. Caregivers
   in both groups, as well as survivors in the ISR group, experienced
   improvements in depressive symptoms and other select outcomes.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that HiH is feasible to implement with
   stroke dyads and that it merits further refinement and testing.},

Abstract = {The effects of caregiver burden during the inpatient rehabilitation
   period have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the burden on stroke survivors' caregivers during the inpatient
   rehabilitation period, and to compare the associations of robot-assisted
   gait training and conventional therapy with caregiver burden. Our
   randomized, crossover, prospective study included 63 stroke survivors
   and their caregivers, who were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
   The patients in group I received robot-assisted gait training for 2
   weeks, followed by conventional therapy for a further 2 weeks. The
   patients in group II received conventional therapy for 2 weeks followed
   by robot-assisted gait training for a further 2 weeks. The caregiver
   burden inventory, beck depression index, and beck hopelessness scale
   were administered to the caregivers at day 0, on the ``switch day{''}
   (day 15), and day 30. Before inpatient rehabilitation, 18 (35\%) of the
   caregivers had somewhat elevated scores on the caregiver burden
   inventory; however, at the end of rehabilitation, 42 (66.6\%) of the
   caregivers were in a high-burden state. The caregiver burden inventory
   scores differed significantly between baseline and the end of
   rehabilitation in both groups. Caregiver depression scores also
   increased significantly in both groups (p < 0.0001), while hopelessness
   scores increased only in group II (p = 0.027). Caregiver burden
   increased during the inpatient stroke rehabilitation period. During
   inpatient rehabilitation, both robot-assisted gait training and
   conventional therapy increased caregiver burden. ClinicalTrials.gov

Abstract = {Perinatal stroke is the most common form of stroke in childhood and is
   followed by a variety of outcomes, with many children experiencing
   specific functional and neuropsychological deficits. The association of
   these outcomes with the psychosocial impact caregivers face is not well
   documented. The goal of our pilot study was to examine caregivers'
   perception of executive behavior and functional abilities among children
   with perinatal stroke, and how these outcomes impact the caregivers. We
   administered three questionnaires to primary caregivers of children with
   perinatal stroke to obtain caregiver-reported measures of (1) executive
   behavior of their child (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
   Function, Second Edition), (2) the functional abilities of their child
   (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test),
   and (3) the psychosocial impact experienced by the caregiver themselves
   (Parental Outcome Measure). Participants included 20 children (mean age
   = 9.3 years, range = 6-16 years) with perinatal stroke and their primary
   caregivers. Functional abilities in the children were rated as
   clinically impaired in the domains of daily activities and mobility.
   Half of the children exhibited clinically impaired ratings on at least
   one executive behavior domain, but the mean scores for these domains did
   not reach clinically impaired levels. Greater ratings of problems in
   daily activities for the child was associated with greater caregiver
   guilt (r= -0.55,p= 0.02). Caregivers of children with perinatal stroke
   who experience limitations in performing daily activities should be more
   closely monitored for adverse impact and be provided the necessary
   support and education to alleviate the associated guilt.},

Abstract = {Objective: The general aim of this study is to identify the events
   experienced by the caregiver (the husband/wife) in providing care to the
   post-stroke partner in Palopo City, South Sulawesi.
   Method: This study is qualitative research using phenomenology design.
   Qualitative study is conducted to find out certain reasons on a topic or
   to understand the occurrence of a topic. The focus of the
   phenomenological approach is on the essence or event experienced by the
   participants.
   Result: The results were processed using NVivo 10; and in terms of
   feelings, it was obtained the feeling of heavy-hearted, angry,
   disappointment, pity, sadness, and normal. The role of the caregivers
   undergoes either changes or no changes. The way of coping with the
   feelings is by accepting the conditions, calming down, talking to
   others, support from the children, the daughters, and other family
   members, praying, and even letting go of the burden. The caregiver
   overcomes the changes in terms of role by managing time and handling the
   situation like it used to.
   Conclusion: Based on the result of the interviews as welt as the data
   analysis, a number of subtheme s were found related to feelings, role
   and ways of overcoming. (C) 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights

Title = {Effect of a tailored multidimensional intervention on the care burden
   among family caregivers of stroke survivors: study protocol for a
   randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Abstract = {Introduction Caring for stroke survivors creates high levels of care
   burden among family caregivers. Previous initiatives at alleviating the
   care burden have been unsuccessful. The proposed study aims to evaluate
   the effect of a tailored multidimensional intervention on the care
   burden among family caregivers of stroke survivors. Based on the
   perceived needs of family caregivers, this intervention takes into
   account scientific recommendations to combine three different
   approaches: skill-building, psychoeducation and peer support.
   Methods and analysis Using a prospective, randomised, open-label,
   parallel-group design, 110 family caregivers will be enrolled from
   Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt between December 2019 and May 2020, and
   randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group.
   The tailored multidimensional intervention will be administered for 6
   months, including three home visits, six home-based telephone calls and
   one peer support session. The primary outcome is the care burden as
   measured using the Zarit Burden Interview. Secondary outcomes include
   changes in the family caregivers' perceived needs (Family Needs
   Questionnaire-Revised), coping strategies (Brief-Coping Orientation to
   Problems Experienced) and quality of life (WHO Quality of Life-BREF).
   Outcomes evaluation will be conducted at baseline (T0), month 3 (T1) and
   month 6 (T2). Independent t-test will be performed to compare the mean
   values of study variables between the two groups at both T1 and T2.
   After adjusting for confounding variables, analysis of covariance will
   be used to assess the effect of the intervention. In addition, repeated
   measures analysis of variance will be conducted to assess changes in
   effect over time.
   Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Research Ethics
   Committee of the Faculty of Nursing, Mansoura University, Mansoura,
   Egypt (P.0195). The results will be published in a scientific
   peer-reviewed journal, and findings will be disseminated at the local
   and international levels.},

Abstract = {Objectives: to understand how the empowerment of family caregivers of
   people with stroke occurs in the hospital environment. Methods: a
   qualitative research, participatory action research, articulated with
   Paulo Freire's Research Itinerary, developed in April 2018 with family
   caregivers, in a Stroke Unit Results: three predominant codes were
   coded: the need for empowerment and autonomy to experience the care
   situation; the challenges experienced in becoming a caregiver; and
   family support Participants presented a lack of information inherent to
   the care process, with distancing from empowerment to perform the
   function in dehospitalization. Dialogue revealed empowerment as a
   possibility for critical awareness and skill development. Conclusions:
   it highlights the importance of directing health promotion for
   caregivers, inserting them in the care process, recognizing their needs
   and intensifying practices that promote empowerment for care, bypassing
   curative actions.},

Title = {THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMOTIONAL STATE AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF FAMILY
   CAREGIVERS OF STROKE PATIENTS AND PATIENT FACTORS},
Journal = {TURKISH JOURNAL OF GERIATRICS-TURK GERIATRI DERGISI},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {374-383},
Abstract = {Introduction: We aimed to evaluate the emotional state and quality of
   life of family caregivers of stroke patients and to investigate the
   relationship between patient factors and these characteristics of
   caregivers.
   Materials and Method: Ninety-seven patients with hemiplegia after a
   cerebrovascular event and their caregivers were included in this
   cross-sectional study. The emotional state of the caregivers was
   evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Their
   quality of life was evaluated with Short Form36. Functional Independence
   Measurement (FIM) and modified-Rankin Score (MRS) were used for
   functional status of the patients, HADS was used for their emotional
   state and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) was used for
   their quality of life.
   Results: Mean HADS-Anxiety score was 9.0 +/- 3.7 and mean
   HADS-Depression score was 8.3 +/- 3.7 in caregivers. Mean HADS-Anxiety
   score was 10.1 +/- 3.4 and mean HADS-D score was 8.7 +/- 3.6 in
   patients. The rates of anxiety disorder and depression in caregivers
   were 39.2\% and 55.7\%, respectively. The rates of anxiety disorder and
   depression in stroke patients were 40.2\% and 50.5\%, respectively. A
   positive correlation was found between HADS scores of caregivers and
   patients (p < 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation
   between the HADS scores of caregivers and SS-QOL scores of patients (p <
   0.05). There was a statistically significant relationship between the
   quality of life of caregivers and the MRS, motor FIM and FIM-total
   scores of patients (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: As a result, mood disorders were common in stroke patients
   and their caregivers. Quality of life of caregivers was decreased. There
   was a relationship between the emotional state of patients and
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {Objective: African Americans are disproportionately affected by stroke
   in the United States (US). The purpose of this study is to explore
   experiences, wants, and needs of African Americans with stroke and their
   family caregivers residing in the stroke belt across the care continuum
   using the `Timing It Right' (TIR) framework as a conceptual guide.
   Design: We conducted a series of focus groups among 20 African Americans
   living with stroke and 19 family caregivers. Focus groups were
   audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. For this secondary analysis, we
   coded qualitative data using the TIR framework. Results: Participants in
   this sample identified pre-stroke needs in addition to the TIR phases
   that span across the care continuum and into community living. We
   identified four important contextual factors and real-world conditions
   that operate in the background and influence the post-stroke needs of
   this specific population across the TIR framework: (1) religion, faith,
   and church, (2) healthcare delivery, (3) community, and (4) sentinel
   events. Conclusions: We propose a TIR model that expands upon the
   original TIR framework which includes factors important for
   consideration when developing and delivering community-based
   interventions among African Americans with stroke and family caregivers
   in the southeastern US.},

Abstract = {Stroke caregivers represent a distinct population and require unique
   considerations when conducting intervention research. Unfortunately,
   there are few published recommendations for conducting intervention
   trials with stroke caregivers. Thus, the goal of this paper is to
   provide foundational guidance for stroke caregiving researchers. We
   describe lessons learned from three trials of the RESCUE intervention to
   illustrate methodological issues in stroke caregiver research. We
   identify challenges encountered while conducting a clinical
   demonstration project, pilot study, and multi-site randomized controlled
   trial of a problem-solving and skills-building stroke caregiver
   intervention. We use our research experiences to exemplify or enhance
   understanding of each issue and describe the strategies we employed to
   overcome these obstacles. We present issues related to and
   recommendations for study design, theoretical frameworks, eligibility
   criteria, recruitment and retention, human subjects protection,
   intervention design, treatment fidelity, outcome measures, and
   qualitative methods. Identifying approaches to circumvent methodological
   challenges can help advance research on and implementation of stroke
   caregiver programs.},

Abstract = {The role of families in providing care for stroke patients at home can
   cause ongoing stress, and can be a burden to caregivers. The purpose of
   this study was to analyze the influence of factors of age, sex,
   education, employment, family relationship, length of care, duration of
   care, health problems of caregiver, and deficit neurology of stroke on
   the burden of caregivers. Study used analytical design through cross
   sectional approach. Samples of 120 caregivers were taken in 2 Puskesmas
   namely Pegirian and Pucang Sewu in Surabaya City with simple random
   sampling technique. Research instruments in the form of questionnaires
   compiled by researchers. Multiple linear regression used to analyze the
   influence of several factors on the burden of caregiver among stroke
   patients. The results of the t-test can be concluded that there is no
   partial effect on age, gender, family relationship, education,
   employment, length of care, health problems of caregivers, and deficit
   neurology of stroke on the burden of caregiver among stroke patients,
   and only the duration of care is influential against the burden of
   caregiver among stroke patients (p value 0.001).},

   caregivers of stroke survivors were selected by convenience sampling
   from Sina and Firouzgar Hospitals in Tehran province in Iran, in 2015.
   The data was collected by two questionnaires including demographic
   questionnaire and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The collected data
   were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics including mean
   and standard deviation using SPSS software (version 15).
   Results The mean GHQ score was 61.41 +/- 14.9; in female caregiver, it
   was 63.07 +/- 16.09, and in male caregiver, the score was 58.33 +/-
   12.28. Significant correlation found between overall GHQ score and
   either of the factors such as occupational status, age category, or type
   of caring (P=0.01). Unemployment in caregiver, aging, and 24-hour caring
   of stroke survivors were related to a reduction in GHQ score. However,
   there was no significant association between GHQ of stroke caregivers
   and either of the factors such as sex (P=035), time of caring (0.24),
   marital status (P=0.71), or educational status.
   Conclusion This study showed that family caregivers of stroke survivors
   experience deterioration of general health at different dimensions.
   Therefore, it is recommended that planning for general health and social
   support for caregivers should be done through policy making in health
   and treatment.},

Abstract = {Aim: The majority of caregivers for stroke patients in Malaysia are
   informal caregivers, although there are no valid tools to measure their
   knowledge regarding caregiving. Therefore, this study validated the
   Caregiving Knowledge Questionnaire (CKQ-My) as an assessment of
   Malaysian stroke caregivers' knowledge regarding patient positioning and
   feeding. Methods: Back-to-back translation was used to produce a
   bilingual version of the questionnaire. Hand drawings were used to
   replace photographs from the original questionnaire. Face validity and
   content validity were assessed, and construct validity was determined by
   comparing responses from informal caregivers, medical students, and
   primary care doctors. Finally, the internal consistencies of the
   subscales were determined. Results: Pretesting showed that the
   translated version was sufficiently easy to understand. Internal
   consistency for the positioning subscale (28 items, Cronbach's alpha =
   0.70) and feeding subscale (15 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.70) was good.
   Mean scores for the positioning subscale for caregivers (mean: 17.1 +/-
   3.9), medical students (mean: 18.9 +/- 3.1), and doctors (mean 21.5 +/-
   2.2) were significantly different (F = 5.28, P = 0.011). Mean scores for
   the feeding subscale for caregivers (mean 13.1 +/- 2.5), medical
   students (mean 16.1 +/- 1.9), and doctors (mean 16.1 +/- 2.4) also
   differed significantly (F = 6.217, P = 0.006). Conclusions: CKQ-My has
   good internal consistency and construct validity for the subscales
   measuring stroke caregivers' knowledge about positioning and feeding of
   stroke patients. It has potential as an assessment of effectiveness of
   caregiver training and for future studies on long-term stroke outcomes
   in Malaysia.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In this study, it was aimed to assess the prevalence of
   depressive symptoms among patients with stroke and their caregivers and
   to determine factors associated with depression.
   Materials and Method: This study included 97 patients with subacute and
   chronic stroke and 88 caregivers. Patients were evaluated using the
   Brunnstrom motor recovery scale for motor functions, Mini-Mental State
   Examination for cognitive status, Rivermead Mobility Index for mobility
   and Barthel Index for functional status. The patients and their
   caregivers were evaluated for mood disorders using the Beck Depression
   Inventory, and quality of life was evaluated using the Nottingham Health
   Profile.
   Results: Among the participants, 61.9\% of the patients and 52.6\% of
   the caregivers were found to have depressive symptoms. Althought
   comparison of the quality of life scores of the patients and their
   caregivers revealed no significant difference, only the physical aspect
   of quality of life was significantly higher in the patients. Depression
   scores were higher in the patients than in their caregivers. Motor
   functional outcomes of the hand along with mobility, cognitive functions
   and functional status scores were significantly negatively correlated
   with depression scores of the patients. Functional status scores of the
   patients were significantly positively correlated with motor functional
   outcomes (hand and upper/lower extremity), mobility and cognitive
   function scores.
   Conclusion: Functional independence and mobility are the best predictors
   of depressive symptoms in patients with stroke. Assessment and treatment
   of depression in not only in patients but also their caregivers should
   be a part of the general rehabilitation plan since the early stages of
   stroke.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is one of the most prevalent chronic illnesses
   worldwide. Family caregivers can make a significant contribution toward
   patients' recovery. However, the patient's functional deficits and the
   caregiver's mood states can impact the caregiver's motivation to engage
   in empathic responses toward patients. Clinicians need help in
   recognizing patients at risk for not receiving empathic responses from
   family caregivers who are pivotal in long-term help and emotional
   support. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine possible
   associations of family caregiver perceptions of functional deficits of
   patients who are poststroke and caregiver mood states with their
   empathic responses toward patients who are poststroke. Methodology: As
   guided by Davis' organizational model on empathy, we conducted a
   correlational descriptive study of associations among patient functional
   deficits, caregiver mood states, and caregiver empathic responses toward
   patients who are poststroke. Participants were requested to complete
   four questionnaires. Results: Caregiver fatigue was the only mood state
   significantly associated with their empathic responses toward patients
   who are poststroke. Conclusions: The results of the current study
   contribute to the current state of the literature on poststroke care at
   home by highlighting the impact of caregiver mood states, particularly
   caregiver fatigue, on their empathic responses toward patients who are
   poststroke. Recommendations for clinical practice and future studies
   were made based on this study's results.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship of family caregiver's feeling of
   burden with: the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the patient,
   caregiver's general mood and perceived quality of life. Method:
   Cross-sectional research performed on 32 urban Argentinian caregivers.
   They answered the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), the Beck Depression
   Inventory, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), and the
   World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL.) Results:
   As psychiatric symptoms on the patient increase, a decrease can be
   observed on the quality of life of the family caregiver. As depression
   on the patient deepens, the caregiver experiences a greater burden.
   Discussion: Supplemental information on the need to include the
   assessment of the psycosocial condition of family caregivers of patients
   who had suffered strokes is added with the sole intention of preserving
   their health.},

Title = {Stroke Caregiver Depression Qualitative Comparison of Treatment
   Responders and Nonresponders at 1 Year},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Mixed-method studies can shed light on the mechanisms through
   which interventions effectively reduce caregiver depression. OBJECTIVE
   The objective of this qualitative study was to understand factors
   contributing to reduced depressive symptoms in stroke caregiver
   treatment responders compared with nonresponders. METHODS A
   mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used to assess cognitive
   behavioral coping use and helpfulness in reducing depression among
   experimental study treatment responders and nonresponders. Using
   purposive sampling at 1-year of caregiving, we selected responders who
   were not depressed or demonstrated reduction to probable depression and
   nonresponders whose scores indicated worsened or new depression.
   Participants responded to semistructured interviews on life changes and
   the use and helpfulness of intervention coping strategies. Thematic
   analysis identified codes and themes. RESULTS Twelve of 25 participants
   were responders. We identified 2 overarching outcome themes: ``It was
   about me, changing to make life better{''} (responders) and ``Lamenting
   our changed lives{''} (nonresponders). Five subthemes related to coping
   were identified. Whereas responders coped actively and were less
   dependent on the counseling relationship, nonresponders were passive in
   coping and more dependent on the initial counseling relationship. Anger
   or previous psychologic treatment was found in more than a quarter of
   nonresponders and in no responders. Negative life change was found in 9
   of 13 nonresponders compared with 1 responder. CONCLUSION Findings
   support the helpfulness of cognitive behavioral coping. For many
   caregivers, engagement interviews and a more intense, longer
   intervention, such as stepped care and anger management, are indicated
   to mitigate treatment resistance and depressive symptoms, respectively.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the quality of life of stroke survivors and
   their caregivers presenting to a tertiary care setup.Method: The
   descriptive study was conducted from July to December 2019 at the
   Neurology Department, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad,
   Pakistan, and comprised patients of either gender with ischaemic or
   haemorrhagic stroke aged 40-70 years and their caregivers. Data was
   collected using the stroke-specific quality of life Scale and the
   caregiver quality of life questionnaire. Data was analysed using SPSS
   20.Results: Of the 80 patients, 50(62.5\%) were males and 30(37.5\%)
   were females. The overall mean age was 61.46 +/- 11.80 years, and
   56(70\%) were aged >55 years. Among the patients, speaking power,
   mobility and mood were more affected with mean levels of 15.51 +/- 8.63,
   22.63 +/- 8.33 and 19.08 +/- 7.05, respectively. The domains of social
   role, self-care and upper extremity function were also affected with
   mean values of 19.022 +/- 7.06, 15.71 +/- 8.81 and 18.88 +/- 7.02,
   respectively. Among the caregivers, the levels of physical wellbeing and
   functional wellbeing were high 15.07 +/- 5.65 and 15.35 +/- 5.76,
   respectively. There were differences in terms of age and gender but the
   difference was not significant (p>0.05).Conclusion: The quality of life
   of stroke survivors was low, and that of caregivers was also quite
   compromised.},

Title = {The downward referral experiences of stroke caregivers in the regional
   medical alliance in China: A phenomenological study},
Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {101},
Number = {42},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {The downward referral platform in the regional medical alliance has
   provided more possibilities to follow-up rehabilitation and transitional
   care for increasing stroke survivors, which also has the most
   contributions in the rational use of resources and health promotion of
   stroke survivors. However the downward referral rate is low compared to
   upward referral. At present, no scholars have explored the downward
   referral experiences of medical demanders from the perspective of
   qualitative study, and these experiences may also most truly reflect the
   influencing factors of their unwillingness to downward referral.
   Therefore, this study explored the subjective experiences of stroke
   caregivers who had experienced the downward referral, because stroke
   attacks often lead to lack of autonomy of patients themselves, making it
   difficult to complete interviews with them. A descriptive
   phenomenological study was adopted. A purposive sampling strategy was
   used to recruit 13 stroke caregivers. Interviews were guided by a
   semi-structured interview-guide encouraging interviewees to reflect on
   their experiences with downward referral. Coliazzi's data analysis
   process was applied. The analysis of the data revealed 4 themes: coping
   challenges; disrupted information; gaps in medical and nursing
   transition, and potential enabling factors. The results of this study
   showed that the lack of knowledge of medical alliance, non-sharing of
   medical information and non-homogeneousness of medical quality were
   identified to be impeding positive attitude towards downward referral
   and be factors of bad experiences. Of course, the interviewees had
   positive experiences such as smooth referral and comfortable
   environment. These may be potential enabling factors to their attitude
   towards downward referral. The challenges and needs of medical demanders
   after downward referral are worthy of attention, and these should be
   solved by corresponding measures to improve the downward referral rate
   and referral experiences.},

Title = {Associations among disability, depression, anxiety, stress, and quality
   of life between stroke survivors and their family caregivers: An
   Actor-Partner Interdependence Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING},
Abstract = {Aim To explore the effects of disability, depressive, anxiety and stress
   symptoms on patients' and their partners' quality of life (QoL) using
   the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM). Design A cross-sectional
   study using actor-partner interdependence model. Methods We recruited
   183 dyads of stroke survivors and their family caregivers in Indonesia.
   The World Health Organization Disability Assessment (WHODAS 2.0),
   Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-42) and Rand Short Form Health
   Survey (SF-36) were used to measure disability, depressive, anxiety and
   stress symptoms and QoL of stroke survivors and family caregivers. The
   actor-partner interdependence model was tested using multilevel
   modelling. The actor-partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM)
   was applied to estimate the direct and indirect effect. Results
   Disability had actor effects on stroke survivor's overall QoL and
   partner effect on family caregiver's overall QoL. More severe disability
   of stroke survivors was associated with a lower overall QoL of their own
   and that of family caregiver's overall QoL. Depressive symptoms of
   stroke survivors had actor effects on stroke survivors' overall QoL and
   partner effects on family caregivers' overall QoL. Actor and partner
   effects also exist on family caregiver's depression symptoms to their
   own overall QoL and stroke survivor's overall QoL. Moreover, higher
   anxiety symptoms were associated with lower levels of their own and
   partner's overall QoL in both stroke survivors and family caregivers.
   Stroke survivor's stress symptoms also negatively associated with their
   own and family caregiver's overall QoL. However, a family caregiver's
   stress without a partner effects on stroke survivor's overall QoL. The
   APIMeM analysis showed that disability of stroke survivors directly
   decreased their own overall, physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Also,
   disability mediated by stroke survivor's depression, anxiety and stress
   symptoms decreased both stroke survivor's and family caregiver's
   physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Conclusion The findings suggest
   that stroke survivors and family caregivers may influence each other
   during the caregiving process and social life. The disability of stroke
   survivors, and the depression, anxiety and stress symptoms of stroke
   survivors and family caregivers affect their own QoL and their partners'
   QoL. Disability of stroke survivors directly decreased their own
   overall, physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Also, it indirectly via
   stroke survivor's depression, anxiety and stress symptoms decreased both
   stroke survivor's and family caregiver's physical (PCS) and mental QoL
   (MCS). Impact Dyadic actor-partner interdependence models have shown
   promising potential to predict the QoL among patients and family
   caregivers. The dyadic effects of disability, depression, anxiety and
   stress symptoms on the QoL of stroke survivors and family caregivers can
   be applied to guide the future development of nursing intervention
   addressed decreasing depression, anxiety and stress symptoms to optimize
   health outcomes among stroke survivors and their family caregivers.},

Title = {Prevalence of chronic non-specific low back pain among caregivers of
   stroke survivors in Kano, Nigeria and factors associated with it: A
   cross-sectional study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},

Abstract = {PurposeLow back pain (LBP) may have a specific or non-specific cause
   such as abnormal posture or repetitive tasks. For instance, lifting and
   transferring patients during caregiving for stroke survivors may
   predispose the caregivers to LBP. ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to
   determine the prevalence of chronic non-specific LBP and factors
   associated with it in caregivers of stroke survivors. MethodThe research
   design used is cross-sectional study design. Participants of the study
   were caregivers of stroke survivors in Kano, Nigeria who were at least
   18 years old. They were included if they had at least one-month
   experience with caregiving for at least 1 h per day. Presence of LBP and
   level of disability were assessed using participants' self-report and
   Rolland Morris Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire respectively. The
   data collected was analyzed using descriptive, Chi-square statistics and
   Binary Logistics Regression. ResultThree hundred caregivers with mean
   age, 33.24 +/- 10.32 years in which 207 and 93 were males and females
   respectively, participated in the study. The results showed that, there
   was a high prevalence (64.7\%) of LBP among the caregivers. The
   prevalence was significantly associated with gender (p < 0.001), age (p
   = 0.029), occupation (p < 0.001) and duration of caregiving (p < 0.001)
   of the study participants. In addition, the result of the regression
   model showed that, being a female (p = 0.001), a civil servant (p =
   0.031), a trader (p = 0.013), and a complete caregiver (0.001); and
   caregiving for a duration of 5 h or more per day (p = 0.024) are
   significant predictors of having LBP. Similarly, level of disability due
   to the presence of LBP among the study participants was significantly
   associated with gender (p < 0.001), occupation (p < 0.001), duration of
   caregiving (p = 0.025), and the nature of the caregiving (p < 0.001).
   ConclusionInformal caregiving for stroke survivors may result in
   developing chronic non-specific LBP, especially among females, Civil
   servants, traders, complete caregivers and those with long duration of
   caregiving. This can add an additional burden on the family in terms of
   cost of care, result in reduced quality of caregiving and cause
   psychological stress. Thus, it is important the health of the caregivers
   of stroke survivors is considered during stroke rehabilitation.},

Title = {Factors Associated With Depression Among Family Caregivers of Patients
   With Stroke in Indonesia: A Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Background Strokes may lead to increased dependency, which may impact
   the daily lives of patients with stroke and their family caregivers.
   Caring for a poststroke family member in Indonesia may differ from other
   countries in terms of extending beyond the provision of hands-on care.
   Contradictions and gaps in the factors affecting caregiver depression
   have been highlighted in a review of the relevant literature. Few
   studies have examined comprehensively the contradictory factors,
   uncovered factors, and cultural and spiritual values affecting this
   phenomenon. Purpose This study was designed to identify the factors
   associated with depression in family caregivers of patients with stroke
   in Indonesia. We examined the following factors related to caregiver
   depression: demographic characteristics of the caregiver and care
   recipient, functional ability of the patient, caregiver self-efficacy,
   knowledge regarding stroke care, and spiritual values. Methods In this
   cross-sectional study, 157 primary caregivers completed questionnaires
   involving depression factors during face-to-face interviews. The data
   were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results The prevalence
   of depression among the participants was 56.7\%. The overall mean ages
   of the participants and their care recipients were 43.6 and 57.1 years,
   respectively. In this study, 65.6\% of the participants were female, and
   70.1\% lacked knowledge regarding stroke care. In the early caregiving
   phase, caregiver depression was more likely to occur in female
   caregivers with back pain and long care hours. Self-efficacy in
   achieving respite time was found to be associated with a lower risk of
   depression. Conclusions/Implications for Practice Caregivers' gender,
   presence of back pain, sufficient respite time, and time since stroke
   occurrence should be considered when providing knowledge, skills, and
   coping strategies to caregivers to help them adapt to their caregiving
   role, maintain their quality of life, and prevent the onset of
   depression. Understanding the factors influencing caregiver depression
   may help nursing professionals identify individuals at a higher risk of
   depression early on and provide critical follow-up and early access to
   supportive counseling.},

   Periodic follow-up visits, previously planned procedures, and
   rehabilitation services for stroke survivors have been cut down during
   the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, in this qualitative study we
   aimed to explore the need for a mobile application in stroke management
   by informal caregivers. Methods: A phenomenological qualitative study
   was conducted from November 2020 to June 2021. Thirteen respondents were
   recruited from two public rehabilitation centers in Kota Bharu,
   Kelantan, Malaysia. In-depth interviews were conducted. A comprehensive
   representation of perspectives from the respondents was achieved through
   purposive sampling. The interviews were conducted in the Kelantanese
   dialect, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using thematic analysis.
   Results: Thirteen participants were involved in the interviews. All of
   them agreed with the need for a mobile application in stroke management.
   They believed the future stroke application will help them to seek
   information, continuous stroke home care, and help in the welfare of
   caregivers and stroke patients. Conclusions: The current study revealed
   two themes with respective subthemes that were identified, namely,
   self-seeking for information and reasons for using a stroke mobile
   application in the future. This application helps in reducing healthcare
   costs, enhancing the rehabilitation process, facilitating patient
   engagement in decision making, and the continuous monitoring of patient
   health.},

Abstract = {Family caregivers provide round-the-clock care to their family members
   who had a stroke. The detrimental effects of caregiving on caregiver's
   health would lead to the abandonment of caregiver role and
   institutionalization of stroke survivors. This study aims to determine
   the factors associated with the perceived health status of family
   caregivers to stroke survivors. This study conducted a secondary
   analysis of the baseline data of 142 family caregivers of stroke
   survivors nested within a longitudinal randomized controlled trial.
   Potential factors were identified according to the Pittsburgh Mind-Body
   Center model and were analyzed with hierarchical multiple regression
   models. The results indicated that stroke caregivers exhibited
   comparable perceived physical health with general population but poorer
   perceived mental health. Severity of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.37,
   P < .001) remained the strongest and most significant factor associated
   with perceived mental health, followed by confidence in problem-solving
   (beta = -0.21, P < .05). Moreover, caregiving competence (beta = 0.29, P
   < .001) was the sole significant psychological factor associated with
   perceived physical health. Caregiving competence, problem-solving
   abilities, and severity of depressive symptoms are significant
   modifiable correlates of the perceived health of caregivers.
   Intervention for improving these psychological responses of caregivers
   is suggested incorporated in stroke rehabilitation programs.},

Title = {Experiences and needs of the caregivers of stroke survivors in
   Malaysia-A phenomenological exploration},

Abstract = {IntroductionInformal caregivers play a crucial role in supporting the
   activities of daily living, rehabilitation, and the road to recovery for
   stroke survivors. However, these informal caregivers are often reported
   as experiencing neglect and lack of recognition despite their primary
   contribution to stroke recovery. This study investigated the experiences
   of the caregivers of stroke survivors and access to stroke care in
   Malaysia. MethodThis qualitative study with a phenomenological approach
   utilized in-depth interviews, including ten primary caregivers, one
   formal caregiver, and stroke healthcare providers as the participants.
   The interviews were done until the data saturation was achieved, and the
   data was analyzed using thematic analysis. ResultThree primary themes
   and 14 subthemes were identified from the interviews. The role of
   primary caregivers of stroke survivors had tremendous physical, mental
   and social impact on the caregivers. Caregivers had two primary needs.
   The need for information about comprehensive stroke care at home and the
   need for psychological support to themselves. The key internal driver
   for providing care was identified to be the motivation level of the
   stroke survivor and the external driver was identified to be the
   societal support with access to comprehensive stroke care. ConclusionThe
   role of informal caregivers becomes critical for continuum of stroke
   care. As caregivers take up the roles and responsibilities of those who
   contribute to stroke rehabilitation single-handedly soon after hospital
   discharge. Results of this study highlights the needs for providing
   systematic support to caregivers for engaging them in effective stroke
   care, particularly in the community. Stroke service providers, policy
   makers and program planners must be sensitized to empower caregivers of
   stroke survivors in effectively supporting stroke survivor in their
   family on the road of recovery.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the potential mediating role of
   resilience between care burden and depressive symptoms in family
   caregivers of stroke patients. MethodsA cross-sectional study was
   conducted with a convenience sample involving 245 main family caregivers
   of stroke patients recruited from the neurology department of a Tertiary
   A hospital in China. Mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS
   macro (Model 4) for SPSS, applying the Bootstrap analysis with 5,000
   samples and a 95\% confidence interval. ResultsThe results showed that
   with constant hemiplegia side, Barthel Index, education level, monthly
   income, care time per day, and living with patients in regression
   equations, the resilience partially mediated the correlation of care
   burden and depressive symptoms with a mediation effect ratio of 26.32\%.
   ConclusionsResilience plays a mediating role in the correlation between
   care burden and depressive symptoms. ImpactThe findings indicated a
   protective effect of resilience in alleviating the negative influences
   of care burden on depressive symptoms, suggesting that
   resilience-training intervention may be developed to mitigate depressive
   symptoms of the main family caregivers of stroke patients.},
