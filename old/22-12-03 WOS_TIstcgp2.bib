Abstract = {Objective: To determine the burden and quality of life of caregivers of
   stroke survivors with cognitive impairment in selected healthcare
   facilities in Anambra State, Nigeria. Methods: This was a
   cross-sectional survey using the World Health Organization QOL-BREF and
   Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) as instruments. Descriptive statistics of
   frequency, percentage counts, mean and standard deviation were used to
   summarize the socio-demographics. Spearman's ranked order correlation;
   Mann-Whitney U test assessed the correlation and gender and age
   difference in QoL and caregiver's burden. Alpha level was set at 0.05.
   Results: Physical health domain of QOL was slightly moderate (53.29 +/-
   15.19), psychological health was low (46.33 +/- 16.96), social
   relationship was slightly moderate (51.16 +/- 0.31), environmental
   health was slightly moderate (51.22 +/- 15.88), the burden of caregivers
   was high (6.35 +/- 1.29). Conclusion: The quality of life of the
   caregivers of stroke survivors with cognitive impairment was moderate,
   and the caregivers' stress was high in the sample of the population
   studied.},

Journal = {CLINICAL NURSING RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences and needs of
   family caregivers of stroke patients who require physical restraints.
   The themes and sub-themes that emerged included ``the reason for the use
   of PR{''} (disruptive behaviors of the patient and personal reasons of
   caregivers), ``the turmoil of having to use PR{''} (inevitableness,
   comparing benefits and harms, the emotional effect of PR, and physical
   effects), and ``unmet needs and suggestions{''} (unmeet needs and
   suggestions). Nurses should take the experiences of patient relatives
   into account in the process of PR application, organize training
   programs, and determine application standards for PR.},

Title = {Disagreement about perceptions of patient disability between the stroke
   patient and caregiver: a cross sectional study exploring the association
   to patient and caregiver quality of life},
Journal = {AGING \& MENTAL HEALTH},
Abstract = {Objectives This study explored the association of disagreement in the
   perception of patient disability between patients and family caregivers
   with physical and psychological quality of life (QOL) in both parties.
   Methods A cross-sectional analysis of data collected from male stroke
   patients and family caregivers was conducted. Physical and psychological
   QOL in patients and caregivers were measured using the WHOQOL BREF.
   Perceptions of patient disability were measured using the 12-item WHO
   Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (DAS). Using DAS scores reported
   independently by patients and caregivers, dyads were categorized into
   one of four groups representing agreement or disagreement about patient
   disability. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the
   associations between WHOQOL scores in patients and caregivers and these
   four groups. Results Among 56 dyads enrolled, approximately 52\% were
   categorized into `agreement' groups and 48\% were categorized into
   `disagreement' groups. The disagreement in perception about patient
   disability were significantly associated with poor patient physical QOL.
   However, the disagreement in perception were not significantly
   associated with caregiver QOL. Conclusion Findings suggest the
   association of disagreement with QOL differs between patients and
   caregivers. Further research is needed to carefully appraise the
   relationship and interaction between patient and caregiver.},

Title = {Coaching-Based Teleoccupational Guidance for Home-Based Stroke Survivors
   and Their Family Caregivers: Study Protocol for a Superior Randomized
   Controlled Trial},
Journal = {EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background. Home-based rehabilitation has been shown to be useful for
   stroke survivors to participate in daily life activities and return to
   their families. However, many home-based stroke survivors face
   challenges in the lack of professional guidance, rational training
   plans, and insufficient motivation, which will affect their
   rehabilitation outcomes to varying degrees. Though occupational therapy
   and coaching are widely recommended for stroke rehabilitation, studies
   that combine these two interventions via telerehabilitation in
   home-based rehabilitation are limited. Hence, this study will explore
   whether coaching-based teleoccupational guidance (CTG) will help stroke
   survivors and caregivers obtain satisfactory outcomes. Methods. This
   single-blind (assessor), two-arm parallel superior randomised controlled
   trial will be conducted in the Hebei General Hospital, Shijiazhuang,
   China. Ninety-two participant dyads in home-based rehabilitation will be
   recruited and randomised to either CTG (intervention group) or a
   standard telerehabilitation group (control group). Participant dyads in
   the intervention group will follow a 6-step circle procedure and receive
   12 teleoccupational coaching sessions over 3 months via WeChat. Data
   will be collected at baseline, after the intervention (3 months), and
   follow-up (6 months). The Reintegration to Normal Living Index will be
   the primary outcome to assess the participation of stroke survivors.
   Secondary outcomes will not only involve an observation of changes in
   activities of daily living, intrinsic motivation, motor function, and
   quality of life of stroke survivors but also will focus on the
   caregivers' perceived benefit and care burden. Discussion. This trial
   will assess the effects of CTG compared with standard
   telerehabilitation. We believe that the results of this study will add
   to the understanding of occupational therapy for stroke survivors in
   home-based rehabilitation and provide a reference for developing health
   policy and facilitating other chronic management.},

Abstract = {Purpose/Objective: Stroke caregivers face many challenges after a family
   member experiences stroke. Because caregivers play such a crucial role
   in health care, there is a need for more interventions in web-based
   formats that focus on caregiver psycho-education and skills building. A
   pilot study was devised to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
   value of an active, 4-week telephone and web-based intervention for
   stroke caregivers. Method/Design: A one-group, pretest-posttest design
   with a mixed-methods approach was used. Qualitative data supplemented
   the quantitative findings. Community-dwelling caregivers of stroke
   patients were recruited from the Veterans Health Administration.
   Quantitative data were collected pre and postintervention.
   Semistructured interviews were completed with a subsample of caregivers
   to capture more detail about the acceptability and value of the
   intervention. Results: Ninety-three caregivers were recruited; 72
   caregivers completed the intervention and 21 withdrew (77\% completion
   rate). From pre- to posttest, caregiver depression (p = .008) and
   caregiver burden (p = .013) decreased. Problem-solving abilities and
   health-related quality of life showed no change. Seventy-eight percent
   of caregivers rated the intervention sessions with the nurses as very
   helpful or extremely helpful, and 76\% reported using the
   problem-solving strategies a moderate amount to extremely often.
   Interviews suggest that the intervention was valuable and led to new
   strategies to relieve stress and prioritize health.
   Conclusions/Implications: The intervention was feasible to implement and
   acceptable to caregivers. This intervention shows promise for fulfilling
   a need for more web-based interventions that focus on skills building
   and psycho-education, but more rigorous testing is needed to determine
   effectiveness.
   Impact and Implications There is a shortage of active, tailored
   interventions for family stroke caregivers that focus on skills building
   and psychoeducation that can also be delivered in telehealth formats and
   accommodate caregivers' busy lives. An intervention was developed to
   meet these needs, with the goal of reducing caregiver depressive
   symptoms and caregiver burden. Theoretically grounded in stress and
   coping theory and using a systematic approach to problem-solving, we
   offer a brief yet comprehensive intervention to reduce stroke caregiver
   burden and depression. This was a pilot study. Qualitative and
   quantitative data were compared side-by-side to reveal the intervention
   process and outcomes. Pre/post outcomes on depression, burden, quality
   of life, and problem-solving skills were collected to assess the
   feasibility of the intervention. The lessons learned from this effort
   are relevant to other brief web-based interventions that involve active
   participation between nurses and caregivers. Although more rigorous
   testing is needed to confirm outcomes, the intervention has the
   potential to empower stroke caregivers, help them identify and solve
   common caregiving problems, and address the mental health strain of
   caregiving. The intervention could be a model for clinician-caregiver
   partnerships. Nurses and caregivers discussed, developed, and
   strategized in-home care support for stroke survivors, without the need
   to visit a hospital or clinic.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke family caregivers were already struggling with unmet
   needs and changes in their own lives from providing care. The COVID-19
   pandemic added further stress and disruption to their lives. The purpose
   of this study was to describe life changes in 17 stroke family
   caregivers specifically resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS:
   This study was conducted as a secondary data analysis from an ongoing
   randomized controlled clinical trial testing feasibility of the
   Telehealth Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK III). Using a
   multimethod design, both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed
   to determine caregiver life changes. Quantitative ratings regarding life
   changes were obtained using 17 items adapted specifically for COVID-19
   from the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale. Rigorous content analysis
   procedures for the qualitative data were guided by a start list of codes
   based on the 17 items, with additional themes possible. Representative
   quotes were selected based on author consensus. RESULTS: Findings
   revealed both negative and positive life changes from the COVID-19
   pandemic. Negative life changes included such things as disrupted daily
   routines, limited access to healthcare providers and resources (eg,
   food, masks, hand sanitizers), reduced family and social contact and
   activities, decreased emotional well-being, and problems with performing
   caregiving activities for the survivor. Positive life changes were
   increased use of the Internet and videoconferencing, closer
   relationships with friends, and learning how to access needed resources
   in new ways. CONCLUSION: Stroke family caregivers experienced both
   negative and positive life changes specifically as a result of the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Responses further indicated that COVID-19 affected
   most caregivers in different ways and an individualized approach is
   needed in dealing with caregiver life changes.},

Title = {The moderating role of caregiver preparedness on the relationship
   between depression and stroke-specific quality of life in stroke dyads:
   a longitudinal study},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING},
Abstract = {Aims To examine the moderating role of caregiver preparedness on the
   association between stroke survivors' depression and stroke-specific
   quality of life dimensions. Methods and results We used a multilevel
   modelling approach to analyse trajectories of change in the eight Stroke
   Impact Scale 3.0 subscales {[}i.e. strength, communication, mobility,
   activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living
   (IADL), memory, emotion, hand function, participation] using
   Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Caregiver preparedness significantly
   moderated the association between survivor depressive symptoms and
   survivor communication (B = -0.95, P < 0.01), mobility (B = -0.60, P <
   0.05), and ADL/IADL (B = -0.73, P < 0.01) at baseline; linear change for
   strength (B = 0.83, P < 0.05) and communication (B = 0.66, P < 0.05);
   and quadratic change for strength (B = -0.19, P < 0.01). Although
   caregiver preparedness did not significantly moderate the association
   between survivor depressive symptoms and strength at baseline, there was
   a significant moderating effect for change over time. Higher levels of
   caregiver preparedness were significantly associated with higher
   survivor scores of emotion, hand function, and participation at
   baseline. Conclusions Including immediate caregivers in the care
   process, through a psycho-educational training, would mean having
   better-prepared caregivers and consequently more-healthy stroke
   survivors. Given that preparedness includes coping with stress,
   responding and managing emergencies, assessing help and information may
   require tailored interventions aimed at improving the caregivers' skills
   and knowledge about stroke survivors' management.},

Title = {A Descriptive Qualitative Study of Foreign Caregivers of Older Adult
   Stroke Survivors},
Journal = {GERONTOLOGIST},
Abstract = {Background and Objectives With a growing aging stroke population and the
   changing structure of the society, the demand for foreign caregivers has
   rapidly increased in Taiwan and many other developed countries. However,
   little is known regarding the perception, values, and abilities of
   foreign caregivers and how those may influence their quality of care.
   This study aimed to explore and describe the experiences of Indonesian
   foreign caregivers, the largest migrant working population in Taiwan,
   who reside with and provide support to older adults with stroke and
   their families. Research Design and Methods By adopting a descriptive
   qualitative approach, we conducted semistructured interviews with 22
   Indonesian caregivers (mean age: 36 years) who were providing care to
   community-dwelling older stroke survivors (age >= 65 years) in Taiwan.
   Data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Results Six themes were
   constructed from the interviews: (a) foreign caregiver's background, (b)
   foreign caregiver's perception of the health and functional status of
   stroke survivors, (c) foreign caregiver's values and preferences, (d)
   consequences of caring for stroke survivors, (e)
   skills/abilities/knowledge of foreign caregivers to provide stroke
   survivors with required care, and (f) potential resources that foreign
   caregivers can use. Discussion and Implications Foreign caregivers
   described the positive and negative aspects of caring for stroke
   survivors. Differences in language, religion, culture, values, and
   expectations between foreign caregivers and stroke survivors influence
   the caregiving experience. These findings can help Taiwan and other
   developed countries to better support foreign caregivers providing
   critical care to older adults with stroke and their families.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among experts (using the
   Delphi technique) to validate the informative content that should be
   included in an App to be used by informal caregivers of stroke patients
   in order to improve their quality of life, facilitating access to the
   health care system and involving them in their own health. This
   technique was developed between June and December 2021. The group of
   experts was selected on the basis of previously established criteria,
   and the coefficient of variation (v) was used as a measure of consensus.
   In addition, the concordance index was calculated to determine the
   stability of the different rounds. In the first round, the preliminary
   content, previously elaborated by the research group, was evaluated as
   very appropriate for the objectives set (N-P < 1.07). In addition,
   averages of 4.5 out of five and a coefficient of variation of less than
   0.5 were obtained, confirming the consensus. In the second round,
   suggestions were made by the experts on how to improve the content of
   the information, obtaining 100\% agreement with the results obtained in
   the first round. The results obtained allow a positive evaluation of the
   use of the Delphi method for the elaboration of the information to be
   housed in an App.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is a major cause of burden which can lead to
   anxiety and depressive disorders in stroke patients and their
   caregivers. This study aimed to assess the burden of depression and
   anxiety and covariates as well as its association with functional
   disability level among stroke survivors and caregivers dyads. Methods:
   This cross-sectional study assessed for anxiety and depressive symptoms,
   and perceived burden among survivors of stroke and their caregivers in
   the rehabilitation center of Kinshasa; using the Hospital Anxiety and
   Depression Scale to identify participants with anxiety and depression;
   the Zarit Burden Inventory to assess the burden of depression and
   anxiety; and the modified Rankin scale used to assess functional outcome
   or level of disability. Results: Eight in ten caregivers of stroke
   survivors perceived the burden, which took more expression of depression
   than anxiety, whereas three in ten stroke survivors had a burden
   expressed by symptoms consistent with depressive and anxiety disorders.
   Being married increases the risk of perceiving the burden among stroke
   survivors. We found a positive association between high level of burden
   and depression and anxiety among caretakers of stroke survivors.
   Moreover, our findings did not reveal a statistical association between
   the burden and level of dependence evaluated based on the severity of
   disability. Conclusions: The psychological burden is higher among
   caregivers than stroke survivors. Specialized programs targeted the
   psychological distress, its association with anxiety and depressive
   symptoms; and the functional disability level of stroke survivors should
   be integrated into the rehabilitation center of patients with disabled
   illnesses. Our findings warrant further studies to test the impact of
   reducing psychological burden on functional disability.},

Abstract = {Stroke impacts care dependency, and thus the patient needs home care
   after suffering a stroke. This study was carried out to investigate
   similarities and differences between the assessments made by family
   caregivers and nurses regarding the care dependency level of stroke
   patients in Indonesian hospitals. This study was a comparative study of
   the care dependency of stroke patients. Data were collected on the
   stroke wards on the day of admission using the Care Dependency Scale
   (CDS). The sample consisted of 118 family caregivers and 21 nurses. The
   Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to determine the mean
   differences between the paired data collected by family caregivers and
   nurses. The results of this study show that significant differences
   exist between the family caregivers' and nurses' assessments regarding
   the care dependency levels of stroke patients. Nurses assigned higher
   scores to all CDS items than family caregivers did. Significant
   differences between the family caregivers' and nurses' assessments were
   observed on numerous items of the Care Dependency Scale. This study
   contributes to efforts to raise awareness of potential differences in
   perceived care dependency levels of stroke patients. The findings can
   help nurses plan the patient's discharge together with family
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {Mindfulness is promising for individuals with neurological disorders and
   their caregivers to improve psychological well-being. The potential
   application of a Langerian mindfulness intervention, focused on
   attention to variability, however, is still unknown. The objective of
   the study was to determine the feasibility (usability, satisfaction, and
   potential effectiveness on psychological well-being) of an online
   mindfulness intervention for stroke survivors and caregivers. Using
   mixed methods, 11 stroke survivors and three caregivers participated in
   a 3-week, online, Langerian mindfulness intervention. A semi-structured
   interview assessed the intervention's usability and gathered feedback.
   Self-reported measures about psychological well-being were documented
   remotely 3 times (preintervention, postintervention, and 1-month
   follow-up). Qualitatively, participants were highly satisfied with the
   intervention and reported subjective benefits, but the usability of the
   online platform was poor. None of the self-reported measures changed
   over time. This study provided evidence of feasibility of an online
   Langerian mindfulness intervention in a new population: stroke survivors

Abstract = {Aims and objectives To explore the shared experiences of people with
   stroke and caregivers in preparedness to manage post-discharge care.
   Background People with stroke and caregivers show dyadic effects in
   dealing with post-discharge care challenges. However, few studies have
   explored their shared experiences and unique challenges for each dyadic
   member in preparedness to manage post-discharge care. This study
   addresses this research gap. Design An interpretive approach underpinned
   by Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics. Methods Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with people with stroke and caregivers in 5
   days before hospital discharge (n = 26) or 2 weeks after discharge (n =
   4) between July and December 2019. The study followed a five-step data
   analysis method aligning with Gadamerian hermeneutics. The study
   reporting followed the COREQ checklist. Results Three themes and six
   subthemes were identified. First, both people with stroke and caregivers
   experienced psychological stress, although the sources differed. Second,
   stroke dyads demonstrated resilience built on positive thoughts,
   confidence, and support from family and health professionals. Third,
   stroke dyads exhibited different levels of certainty about
   post-discharge care. They desired to be equal partners in co-developing
   and co-implementing discharge plans. Conclusions Similarities and
   differences in perceived preparedness to manage post-discharge care
   existed between stroke dyadic members. A co-design approach to
   developing and implementing discharge plans would enhance planned
   post-discharge care. Impact Hospital-to-home transition is a challenging
   time for people with stroke and their caregivers. Understanding the
   shared experiences of stroke dyads in preparedness for post-discharge
   care enables nurses to take proactive actions to enhance managing
   post-discharge care. Early identification of those at risk of developing
   psychological stress will enable nurses to co-develop stress-coping
   strategies. These will have a positive influence on the dyad when facing
   setbacks due to stroke-related complications.},

Abstract = {Background: Caregivers of stroke survivors need trusted information on
   stroke prevention, rehabilitation, and self-care.
   Purpose: Develop and evaluate the English and Spanish-language RESCUE
   stroke caregiver websites and conduct a promotional campaign to enhance
   their reach.
   Methods: We developed websites by partnering with organizations and
   using health communication guidelines for consumer-oriented,
   age-appropriate, and culturally sensitive materials. Healthcare provider
   focus groups and caregiver interviews were conducted to obtain feedback.
   Websites were refined and assessed for usability through ``think
   aloud{''} testing and surveys. We implemented a multi-faceted
   promotional campaign and measured website visits.
   Results: Providers (N = 32) and caregivers (N = 47) responded positively
   to the websites, describing them as comprehensive and appropriate.
   Usability testing indicated the websites were appealing, informative,
   and organized. Caregivers with minimal computer skills had difficulty
   navigating the websites. The websites received 218,529 visits over 2
   years. Promotional activities corresponded with increases in website
   visits.
   Discussion: Involving end-users and collaborating with partners enhances
   the accessibility and relevance of online health resources.
   Multi-faceted promotional efforts and key stakeholder partnerships are
   required to enhance and sustain the reach of online caregiving
   resources.
   Translation to Health Education Practice: The RESCUE websites are
   comprehensive public sources of evidence-based materials to support
   stroke patients and their caregivers.},

Title = {Factors Explaining Quality of Life among Family Caregivers of People
   with Stroke in Myanmar: A Cross-sectional Study},

Abstract = {Advanced health care systems have led to increased survival among people
   with stroke; however, the disability level remains high. Caring for the
   people with stroke and consequent disabling conditions places an undue
   strain on their caregivers, which may, in turn, reduce their quality of
   life, subsequently affecting the quality of care. Thus, understanding
   the factors explaining the quality of life is needed to design
   interventions to improve the quality of life among caregivers. This
   correlational study was conducted among 303 family caregivers of people
   with stroke three months after being discharged from hospital to home
   from three general hospitals in Myanmar. Six validated instruments were
   used to collect caregiver data: a demographic questionnaire, the Barthel
   Index, the Zarit Burden Interview, The Brief COPE, the Multidimensional
   Scale of Perceived Social Support and the World Health Organization
   Quality of Life -Brief (WHOQOL-BREF). Data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analysis.
   Results indicated that educational and occupational status of
   caregivers, average family income per month, numbers of caregiving hours
   per day, functional status of people with stroke, the burden of
   caregivers, and perceived social support were significantly accounted
   for 84\% of the variance to the quality of life, which is very high. The
   burden was the most significant factor in explaining the quality of
   life, followed by education and perceived social support. Nurses need to
   apply innovative technology to provide continuous care at home,
   especially in the first three months, to reduce caregivers' burden.
   Also, the Myanmar government needs to strengthen health insurance
   systems to reduce the financial burden, which significantly affects the
   quality of life of the caregivers.},

Title = {Factors impacting the access and use of formal health and social
   services by caregivers of stroke survivors: an interpretive description
   study},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Background Evidence has shown that family and friend caregivers of
   stroke survivors are significantly and negatively impacted by
   caregiving. The negative effects of caregiving may persist over time
   suggesting that caregivers might benefit from ongoing engagement with
   supportive services. However, little is known about caregivers' use of
   formally funded health and social services, or the factors influencing
   their access to and use of these services. The aim of this study is to
   increase understanding of the factors that influence stroke caregivers'
   access and use of formal health and social services, from the
   perspective of stroke caregivers and healthcare providers. Methods A
   qualitative study was conducted with stroke caregivers and health
   providers in Ontario, Canada using interpretive description. In-depth
   interviews were conducted with caregivers of survivors who experienced a
   stroke between six months to five years previous and healthcare
   providers who support caregivers and stroke survivors. All participants
   provided written informed consent. Interview data were analyzed using
   constant comparison to identify codes and develop key thematic
   constructs. Results A total of 40 interviews were conducted with 22
   stroke caregivers at an average 30-months post-stroke and 18 health
   providers. Factors that influenced stroke caregivers' access and use of
   services included: finances and transportation; challenges caregivers
   faced in caring for their health; trust that they could leave their
   family member and trust in health providers; limited information
   pertaining to services and a lack of suitable services; and the response
   of their social networks to their caregiving situation. Conclusion
   Stroke caregivers experience significant challenges in accessing and
   using formal health and social services. These challenges could be
   addressed by increasing availability of subsidized community-based
   supports such as respite and counselling tailored to meet the ongoing
   needs of caregivers. Systemic change is needed by the health system that
   readily includes and supports caregivers throughout the stroke recovery
   continuum, particularly in the community setting.},

Abstract = {Aim. To gain more knowledge of caregiver strain in the Life After Stroke
   Trial (LAST) population. Methods. This is a substudy of the LAST study,
   including all caregivers' reports of perceived Caregiver Strain Index
   (CSI) at inclusion and 18-month follow-up irrespective of group
   allocation. The checklist ``STROBE Statement-Checklist of items that
   should be included in reports of cohort studies{''} was used. Caregivers
   to adults (age >= 18 years), here defined as the person living with, a
   patient with a first-ever or recurrent stroke, community dwelling, with
   modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <5 and no serious comorbidities, was invited
   to fill out the Caregiver Strain Index at three months (10-16 weeks)
   poststroke. Domains indicating differences of change in perceived strain
   in the total sample were analyzed in a linear regression analysis.
   Results. Caregiver strain (n = 147) varying from 5\% to 27\% was
   reported by the caregivers at baseline and between 2\% to18\% at
   18-month follow-up. The items indicating the highest level of strain at
   baseline and 18 months were as follows: ``Care giving is confining,{''}
   ``There have been changes in personal plans,{''} ``There have been
   emotional adjustments,{''} and ``I feel completely overwhelmed.{''} The
   samples were divided into age groups 0-79 years and 80-100 years,
   indicating a higher strain on the caregiver for persons 80-100 years at
   18 months. Conclusion. Caregiver strain was relatively low both at
   baseline and at 18-month follow-up. Main caregiver strains were reported
   in terms of a sense of confinement, a tendency of emotional strain, and
   the altering of plans at both time points. Depression was one of the
   main explanatory factors for the perceived caregiver strain. The
   perception of caregiver strain was higher in age groups 80-100 years
   than age groups 0-79 years.},

Title = {Experiences of family caregivers 3-months after stroke: results of the
   prospective trans-regional network for stroke intervention with
   telemedicine registry (TRANSIT-Stroke)},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {Background: Long-term support of stroke patients living at home is often
   delivered by family caregivers (FC). We identified characteristics of
   stroke patients being associated with receiving care by a FC 3-months (3
   M) after stroke, assessed positive and negative experiences and
   individual burden of FC caring for stroke patients and determined
   factors associated with caregiving experiences and burden of FC 3 M
   after stroke.
   Methods: Data were collected within TRANSIT-Stroke, a regional
   telemedical stroke-network comprising 12 hospitals in Germany. Patients
   with stroke/TIA providing informed consent were followed up 3 M after
   the index event. The postal patient-questionnaire was accompanied by an
   anonymous questionnaire for FC comprising information on positive and
   negative experiences of FC as well as on burden of caregiving
   operationalized by the Caregiver Reaction Assessment and a self-rated
   burden-scale, respectively. Multivariable logistic and linear regression
   analyses were performed.
   Results: Between 01/2016 and 06/2019, 3532 patients provided baseline
   and 3 M-follow-up- data and 1044 FC responded to questionnaires
   regarding positive and negative caregiving experiences and caregiving
   burden. 74.4\% of FC were older than 55 years, 70.1\% were women and
   67.5\% were spouses. Older age, diabetes and lower Barthel-Index in
   patients were significantly associated with a higher probability of
   receiving care by a FC at 3 M. Positive experiences of FC comprised the
   importance (81.5\%) and the privilege (70.0\%) of caring for their
   relative; negative experiences of FC included financial difficulties
   associated with caregiving (20.4\%). Median overall self-rated burden
   was 30 (IQR: 0-50; range 0-100). Older age of stroke patients was
   associated with a lower caregiver burden, whereas younger age of FC led
   to higher burden. More than half of the stroke patients in whom a FC
   questionnaire was completed did self-report that they are not being
   cared by a FC. This stroke patient group tended to be younger, more
   often male with less severe stroke and less comorbidities who lived more
   often with a partner.
   Conclusions: The majority of caregivers wanted to care for their
   relatives but experienced burden at the same time. Elderly patients,
   patients with a lower Barthel Index at discharge and diabetes are at
   higher risk of needing care by a family caregiver.},

Title = {Family function, self-efficacy, care hours per day, closeness and
   benefit finding among stroke caregivers in China: A moderated mediation
   model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING},
Abstract = {Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to explore the moderated
   mediation mechanism of the relationships among family function,
   self-efficacy, care hours per day, closeness and benefit finding in
   family caregivers of patients with stroke in China. Background Benefit
   finding can provide a new means of resolving depression among family
   members caring for an ill loved one. However, current research has paid
   little attention to the benefit finding of family caregivers of stroke
   patients in China. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods Three hundred
   fifty family caregivers of patients with stroke were recruited from
   community service centres and hospitals in Zhengzhou, China. The
   participants completed the family APGAR index, caregiver benefit finding
   scale and Chinese general self-efficacy scale during a study conducted
   in 2017. Descriptive analyses and a moderated mediation model were
   computed. Reporting adhered to the STROBE checklist. Results A total of
   311 family caregivers completed this study. Closeness between family
   caregivers and patients with stroke moderated the relationship between
   family function and caregiver benefit finding. Self-efficacy partially
   mediated the relationship between family function and caregiver benefit
   finding; moreover, care hours per day moderated the mediation.
   Conclusion This study shows important factors associated with benefit
   finding in family caregivers of patients with stroke. This indicates
   elements that could help improve benefit finding intervention programmes
   for family caregivers of patients with stroke. Relevance to clinical
   practice The findings in our study provide valuable information on
   benefit finding and indicate some interventions to improve the mental
   health of family caregivers of stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Background \& Objectives: This study was carried out to evaluate the
   effects of discharge training on quality of life and self-efficacy in
   stroke patients and their informal caregivers; and reintegration to
   normal living in patients only. Methods: In this randomized, controlled
   trial, 59 patients and their caregivers were randomly allocated to
   receive discharge with education (via a webpage or booklet) or a
   standard of care discharge without intervention (i.e. an additional
   training). The 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the General
   Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) were applied to patients and caregivers and
   the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI) were applied to patients
   only, before discharge and 3 months after discharge. Results: It was
   found that, although the quality of life improved by the trainings in
   the patient intervention groups, compared with the control group
   (p<0.05); there was no change in self-efficacy parameter (p>0.05). Both
   self-efficacy and quality of life of the caregivers improved or
   maintained by the interventions, compared with the controls (p<0.05). In
   general, there was no significant difference between training methods
   (webpage versus booklet) (p>0.05). Lastly, the impact of discharge
   trainings on reintegration to normal living which was assessed in the
   patients only, was found to be limited. Conclusion: Although discharge
   training improved the quality of life in both patients and informal
   caregivers, its effect on self-efficacy in both populations and
   reintegration to normal living in patients was found to be limited.},

Title = {The preparedness assessment for the transition home after stroke
   predicts key domains of caregiver health},
Journal = {TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION},
Abstract = {Background: Caregivers of stroke survivors often experience adverse
   health effects due to poor preparation.
   Objectives: We evaluate the concurrent and predictive validity of the
   Preparedness Assessment for the Transition Home after Stroke (PATH-s)
   family caregiver assessment tool relative to important domains of
   caregiver health and stroke survivor outcomes.
   Methods: A convenience sample of caregivers (N = 183) was assessed on
   several health-related quality of life instruments prior to stroke
   survivor discharge (T1), and at 30-days (T2) and 90-days (T3)
   post-discharge.
   Results: Caregivers completed assessments at T1 (N = 183), T2 (N = 116,
   63\%), and T3 (N = 97, 53\%). At T1, the PATH-s demonstrated concurrent
   validity with depressive symptoms (r = -0.26, p < .001), global health
   (r = 0.45 p < .001) and activation (r = 0.34, p < .001). The PATH-s also
   has predicted improvements in T2 outcomes including depressive symptoms
   (r(adj) = -0.21, p < .05), global health (r(adj) = 0.30, p < .01),
   perceived stress (r(adj) = -0.30, p < .01), activation (r(adj) = 0.21, p
   < .05), caregiving-specific health-related quality of life (r = 0.23, p
   < .05), and caregiver strain (r = -0.36, p < .001). At T3, higher scores
   on the PATH-s were a significant predictor for improvements in
   activation (r(adj) = 0.24, p < .05).
   Conclusion: The PATH-s demonstrates good concurrent and predictive
   validity and predicts important domains relevant to caregiver
   well-being. This can be used to identify gaps in caregiver preparedness
   so interventions can be tailored to optimize the transition home and
   mitigate adverse effects of caregiving.},

Abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored multidimensional
   intervention in reducing the care burden of family caregivers of stroke
   survivors. This intervention considered caregivers' perceived needs and
   incorporated three evidence-based dimensions (psychoeducation,
   skill-building and peer support).
   Design A prospective randomised control trial.
   Setting A community-based study conducted in Egypt.
   Participants A total of 110 caregivers aged >= 18 years who cared for a
   survivor within 6 months of stroke, with modified Rankin Scale scores of
   3-5, and without other physical disabilities or terminal illnesses were
   recruited between December 2019 and May 2020. Participants were assigned
   to the intervention group (IC; n=55) and control group (CG; n=55)
   through open-label, parallel 1:1 randomisation.
   Intervention The IG was provided with tailored multidimensional
   interventions for 6 months until November 2020, including three home
   visits, six home-based telephone calls and one peer-support session. The
   CG received simple educational instructions at a single visit.
   Outcome The participants completed the Zarit Burden Interview (primary
   outcome) and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (secondary outcome) before the
   intervention (TO), at 3 months (T1) and at 6 months (T2).
   Results No differences were observed between the characteristics of the
   groups at baseline (T0). The independent t-test showed no significant
   differences in the care burden and Quality of Life (QoL) at T1 and T2
   between the groups. The intervention had no significant effect on the
   outcomes between or within groups over time, as shown by the
   repeated-measures analysis of variance. However, the group and time
   interaction had significant main effects on caregivers' QoL
   (psychological and social domains).
   Conclusion The main results showed that participants in the IG did not
   experience an improvement in the main outcomes. Nevertheless, the
   improvement in the psychological and social domains may have been
   attributed to our intervention.},

Abstract = {Background
   Caregivers often use the internet to access information related to
   stroke care to improve preparedness, thereby reducing uncertainty and
   enhancing the quality of care.
   Method
   Social media communities used by caregivers of people affected by stroke
   were identified using popular keywords searched for using Google.
   Communities were filtered based on their ability to provide support to
   caregivers. Data from the included communities were extracted and
   analysed to determine the content and level of interaction.
   Results
   There was a significant rise in the use of social media by caregivers of
   people affected by stroke. The most popular social media communities
   were charitable and governmental organizations with the highest user
   interaction-this was for topics related to stroke prevention, signs and
   symptoms, and caregiver self-care delivered through video-based
   resources.
   Conclusion
   Findings show the ability of social media to support stroke caregiver
   needs and practices that should be considered to increase their
   interaction and support.},

Title = {Understanding the interplay between lifestyle factors and emotional
   distress for hemorrhagic stroke survivors and their informal caregivers:
   Protocol for a mixed methods dyadic natural history study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and PTS) and unhealthy
   lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet,
   limited physical activity, medication adherence) are common in
   hemorrhagic stroke (HS) survivors and may increase risk for recurrence,
   morbidity, and mortality. Emotional distress and unhealthy lifestyle
   factors tend to be interdependent between survivors and their informal
   caregivers (e.g., family and friends who provide unpaid care; together
   called dyads), such that one partner's lifestyle and coping behaviors
   influence the other's behaviors, yet no research has closely examined
   this relationship in HS dyads over time. We will conduct a mixed methods
   study to quantitatively and qualitatively understand the longitudinal
   relationship between emotional distress and lifestyle factors across
   time in this population (HS dyads) to identify treatment targets to
   prevent emotional distress chronicity and stroke recurrence. In aim 1,
   we will assess emotional distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTS)
   and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, limited
   physical activity medication adherence/blood pressure control) in dyads
   of survivors of HS and their caregivers (N = 80), at three separate time
   points (hospitalization in the Neuro-ICU, 1, and 3 months later). We
   hypothesize that 1) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be
   interrelated within and across time for both survivors and caregivers,
   and 2) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be interdependent
   between survivors and caregivers. We also aim to explore the nuanced
   interplay between lifestyle factors and emotional distress and gain in
   depth information on barriers and facilitators for a dyadic intervention
   to optimize lifestyle behaviors and emotional functioning in HS dyads.
   Eligible patients will be adults who have a caregiver also willing to
   participate. Patients will be referred for study participation by the
   nursing team who will ensure that they are cognitively able to
   meaningfully participate. Multilevel dyadic modeling (i.e.,
   actor-partner interdependence model; APIM) with distinguishable dyads
   will be used to determine influences of these factors onto each other
   over time. In Aim 2, we will conduct live video qualitative dyadic
   interviews (N = 20 or until theme saturation) at all time points from
   the same participants with and without emotional distress and at least
   one lifestyle risk factor, to understand the nuanced relationships
   between emotional distress and lifestyle behaviors, and barriers and
   facilitators to engagement in a skills-based psychosocial intervention.
   Interviews will be analyzed using inductive and deductive approaches.
   The present study is currently ongoing. So far, we enrolled 2
   participants. Recruitment will end October 2022 with plans to analyze
   data by December 2022. The findings from this study will be used to
   further develop psychosocial interventions and inform novel treatments
   for survivors of HS and their informal caregivers.},

Title = {Caregiver strain and fatigue are independent determinants of anxiety
   among patients early after stroke},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION},
Abstract = {Anxiety and depression are common mental health disorders in stroke
   patients, and often co-occur. However, in contrast to depression, there
   is limited research about anxiety after stroke, although impact of
   anxiety can be substantial. Therefore, this cross-sectional
   observational study investigated determinants of anxiety after stroke
   and compared them with determinants of depression after stroke. Stroke
   surviving patients (n = 284) were seen six weeks after discharge from
   the hospital or rehabilitation setting. Of these, 238 patients answered
   all questions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale measuring
   anxiety (HADS-a) and 239 patients answered all questions measuring
   depression (HADS-d). Step-wise regression was used to identify
   independent determinants of anxiety and depression after stroke. Higher
   levels of anxiety were associated with a higher caregiver strain (p <
   0.01) and more fatigue (p < 0.05). In contrast, higher levels of
   depression were associated with lower life satisfaction (p < 0.001) and
   less daily activities (p < 0.05), but also more fatigue (p < 0.001).
   Hence, our results show that both fatigue and caregiver strain are
   associated with higher levels of anxiety, but of these only fatigue is
   also associated with higher levels of depression. Practitioners should
   therefore ask for both anxiety and depression symptoms in stroke
   patients.},

Abstract = {Chronic diseases show a significant limitation on the quality of life
   and functional status, as patients as also their caregivers. The
   objective of this study is to analyse the quality of life of patients
   diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke and
   their caregivers, and to find out if there is a relationship between the
   caregiver's overload and the quality of life of the patient, as well as
   to determine whether the functional status of the patients is related to
   the quality of life of the caregiver. Quantitative, observational,
   descriptive, cross-sectional and prospective study, performed at Primary
   Health Care Centres of the northwest Area of Murcia Region (Spain),
   between January and May 2018, with 131 patients, 79 with stroke, 48 with
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4 of them with both diseases),
   and 110 caregivers. The EuroQol scale, Zarit's questionnaire and
   Barthel's index and an ad hoc questionnaire of sociodemographic
   variables developed for this study were used. We found a positive and
   significant correlation between the scores of the caregiver's overload
   scale and those of the caregiver's health status (r = -0.425; p =
   0.001), and a negative and also significant correlation between the
   overload and quality of life of the patients (r = -0.297; p = 0.002) and
   their inability (r = 0.189; p = 0.048). The more the overload we find
   the worse quality of life of the caregiver, but better quality of life
   of the patient. The physical inability of the patients also influences
   on the caregiver's level of overload, but not in his health status.
   Intervention programmes are needed to improve the quality of life of
   family members as they are the best patient support and the best help
   for healthcare professionals.},

Title = {Family Caregivers' Experiences and Coping Strategies in Managing Stroke
   Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a chronic disease that requires stroke survivors
   to be supported long-term by their families. This is especially because
   of the inaccessibility to post-stroke rehabilitation outside hospitals.
   The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis and the pandemic
   restrictions in Malaysia are expected to exponentially increase the
   demand from family caregivers in supporting stroke survivors. Thus, this
   study aims to explore the burden, experience, and coping mechanism of
   the family caregivers supporting stroke survivors during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Methodology: A phenomenological qualitative study was
   conducted from November 2020 to June 2021 in Malaysia. A total of 13
   respondents were recruited from two public rehabilitation centers in
   Kota Bharu, Kelantan. In-depth interviews were conducted with the
   participants. Comprehensive representation of perspectives from the
   respondents was achieved through purposive sampling. The interviews were
   conducted in the Kelantanese dialect, recorded, transcribed, and
   analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes on burdens and
   experiences were identified. They were worsening pre-existing issues,
   emerging new issues, and fewer burdens and challenges. Two themes on
   coping strategies were also identified. They were problem-focused
   engagement and emotion-focused engagement. Conclusions: The COVID-19
   pandemic has changed the entire system of stroke management. While
   family caregivers mostly faced the extra burden through different
   experiences, they also encountered some positive impacts from the
   pandemic. The integrated healthcare system, especially in the era of
   digitalization, is an important element to establish the collaborative
   commitment of multiple stakeholders to compensate burden and sustain the
   healthcare of stroke survivors during the pandemic.},

Title = {Development and Psychometric Properties of the Caregiver Burden Scale in
   Polish Caregivers of Stroke Patients},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {665-675},
Abstract = {Purpose: Most stroke patients require long-term care of their family
   members. Excessive care burden entails several negative consequences;
   therefore, the severity of the burden should be periodically assessed.
   For this purpose, valid multidimensional measures are needed. Our study,
   which is a part of a larger research project, aims to translate and
   evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish Caregiver Burden
   Scale (CBS) in relation to construct validity and internal consistency
   in caregivers of the patients after stroke.
   Patients and Methods: The sample of this cross-sectional observational
   study consisted of 366 informal caregivers to consecutive first-ever
   stroke survivors. The five-factor Polish CBS and the Hospital Anxiety
   and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered during the home visits at
   three to six months after patients' hospitalisation. Exploratory (EFA),
   confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses and a net analysis were performed to
   investigate the internal structure and a factorial construct validity of
   the CBS. Correlation analyses between the CBS and the HADS were carried
   out to examine convergent validity. Cronbach's alpha and item-total
   correlation were applied to assess internal consistency.
   Results: Three out of five factors identified by EFA were similar to the
   original indices of the CBS, while the remaining two deviated from the
   original structure of the CBS. The CFA five-factor model represented an
   acceptable fit (confirmatory fit index, CFI = 0.96, root mean square
   error, RMSEA = 0.04) but only after a modification. All subscale scores
   of the CBS were positively correlated with the HADS, supporting the
   convergent validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the overall scale
   (0.92) and all subscales (0.72-0.87) except one (0.69) and item-total
   correlation results indicated good internal consistency.
   Conclusion: The Polish version of the CBS showed acceptable internal
   consistency and good convergent validity. Factorial validity and
   structural integrity were partially supported. The interrelationships
   between the CBS subdomains, their partial mutual contamination, and the
   scale's non-orthogonal structure should be considered when interpreting
   the results of further studies using this version of the scale.},

Abstract = {Purpose The specific aims of this scoping review of the literature are
   to (1) map the current scope of literature regarding nonpharmacological
   interventions for informal stroke caregivers and (2) explore the degree
   to which racial/ethnic minority groups were represented in
   nonpharmacological interventions for stroke caregivers in the United
   States. Design and Methods Arksey and O'Malley's methodological
   framework was used to conduct this scoping review. The framework entails
   formulating research questions, developing criteria for selecting
   relevant studies, charting the data, and synthesizing results. Findings
   The scoping review yielded 11 studies that varied in intervention
   design, methods of implementation, and outcome measurements. The review
   indicated that racial and ethnic minorities were less likely to be
   represented in nonpharmacological intervention studies for stroke
   caregivers. Conclusion Currently, there is sparse research that focuses
   on interventions with family caregivers of varying racial/ethnic groups
   in the United States.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the qualitative descriptive first phase of a
   participatory action research study, which aimed to develop a stroke
   prevention model for people at risk of stroke in a tertiary hospital.
   The study's purpose was to explore caregivers' perceptions of
   preventative behaviors for family members at risk of stroke. The
   qualitative data collection was conducted through semi-structured
   interviews held with 36 primary caregivers living for at least one year
   with family members at risk of stroke risk people. All informants were
   recruited through purposive sampling. The interviews were recorded,
   transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis.
   The five emergent categories from the analysis were 1) struggle to
   modify behaviors, 2) lack of adequate knowledge about stroke prevention,
   3) lack of awareness as being caregivers, 4) constraints of being
   caregivers, and 5) receiving unrealistic treatment regimens. These
   findings contribute to the need for interventions that enhance awareness
   and competency of the family caregiver, as well as promote the
   participation and collaboration of care among family caregivers and
   their family members, in addition, redesigning a stroke prevention
   service which appropriate with individual context.},

Abstract = {Objective: This research aims to identify the educational contents for
   the caregiver of post-stroke patients that will be delivered in video
   media.
   Methods: The Delphi technique underwent three rounds to reach an
   agreement. Seven experts participated in all rounds. The first round was
   begun by giving open-questions to the experts. The second round
   collected and evaluated the answers of the first round to be returned to
   the experts for the validity assessment using a Likert-scale.
   Furthermore, the third round was the result of the second round, which
   was re-evaluated and justified as an agreement.
   Results: The results of the first round of the Delphi technique are 17
   topics. The second round produces 11 topics and proceeds to the third
   round. The third round generates 12 topics.
   Conclusion: The expert panel concluded 12 topics to be the content for
   video-based education. (C) 2021 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights

Title = {Caregiver Burden in Caregivers of Acute Stroke Patients: From a

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to evaluate caregiver burden among
   caregivers of acute stroke patients with a biopsychosocial perspective
   in a Turkey sample.
   Methods: 72 stroke patients and 72 their caregivers were included the
   study. The mean age of the stroke patients included in the study was 65
   +/- 12.39. The mean age of caregivers was 44.5 +/- 14 and 66.7\% of them
   were females. Modified Motor Assessment Scale (MMAS), Standardized Mini
   Mental State Examination (SMMSE) and The Barthel Index (BI) were used to
   assess the patients with stroke. The caregivers were evaluated by using
   the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale, Family Sense of Coherence
   Scale-Short Form (FSOC-S), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
   WHOQOL-Bref-Short Form and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
   Support (MSPSS).
   Results: There were significant positive correlation between the BCOS
   score and the SMMSE (r=0.36; p=0.002) and BI (r=0.22; p=0.05) scores. A
   significant positive correlation was found between the BCOS score and
   MSPSS's family (r=0.31; p=0.007), friend (r=0.41; p<0.01) and special
   human (r=0.46; p<0.01) sub-parameters. In addition, there were
   significant positive correlations between BCOS score and the physical
   (r=0.35; p=0.02) and environmental (r=0.42; p<0.01) sub-dimensions of
   the WHOQOL-BREF, also HADS Depression sub-score (r=0.93; p=0.01).
   Correlations between BCOS score and patients' age, MMAS, FSOC-S, scores
   and HAD Anxiety sub-score were not statistically significant (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: The cognitive function and independence level of the
   patients is associated with care burden. Furthermore, psychosocial
   features such as poor social functioning, quality of life and emotional
   health of caregiver have adverse effects on caregiver burden.},

Abstract = {Introduction Stroke is now the second leading cause of adult death in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. Developed in dialogue with stroke survivors and
   caregivers in Sierra Leone, this will be the first study to explore the
   experience of stroke as well as the perceptions of the barriers and
   facilitators to accessing stroke care among stroke survivors, informal
   caregivers and healthcare providers. Findings will inform future stroke
   research and care in Sierra Leone. Methods and analysis A
   cross-sectional qualitative study employing semistructured interviews
   that will be audiorecorded, translated, transcribed and coded. Setting
   Freetown, Sierra Leone. Participants Interviews with a purposive sample
   of stroke survivors, informal caregivers and healthcare providers.
   Analysis Interviews will be coded by two authors and inductively
   analysed using thematic analysis. Ethics and dissemination This study
   has received ethical approval from the Sierra Leone Ethics and
   Scientific Review Committee (8 December 2020) and the KCL Biomedical \&
   Health Sciences, Dentistry, Medicine and Natural \& Mathematical
   Sciences Research Ethics Subcommittee (reference: HR-20/21-21050). The
   findings of the study and learning in terms of the process of
   coproduction and involvement of stroke survivors will be disseminated
   via peer-reviewed publications, conferences, media and lay reports.},

Abstract = {This study reports on outcomes for 169 caregivers enrolled in the
   Michigan Stroke Transitions Trial (MISTT), an RCT of social work case
   management for stroke patients returning home. A mixed-model approach
   examined the mean change from 7- to 90-days post-discharge with
   group-by-time interactions for differences between treatment groups.
   Caregivers reported few life changes or depressive symptoms from
   caregiving. There was no significant change over time or treatment
   effects. Negative aspects of stroke caregiving may take longer to
   develop. Focused caregiver assessment at discharge and a better
   understanding of how caregiving develops over time may improve the type
   and timing of support.},

Title = {Preparedness for caregiving moderates the association between burden and
   health-related quality of life among family caregivers of stroke
   patients in Nigeria},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY},
Abstract = {Studies on improving the health-related quality of life of stroke
   patients are abundant, but less attention has been given to the factors
   influencing the wellbeing of their family caregivers, especially in low-
   to middle-income countries such as Nigeria where the burden of stroke is
   expected to increase. In this study, we examined the moderating role of
   preparedness for caregiving in the connection between the burden of
   caregiving and health-related quality of life of family caregivers of
   stroke patients in Nigeria. Family caregivers of stroke patients (140
   females and 60 males; aged between 18 and 57 years) were purposively
   sampled from a Federal Medical Center in Southeastern Nigeria.
   Participants completed measures of caregiver's strain (burden),
   health-related quality of life, and preparedness to give care. Results
   showed that burden negatively predicted physical health (beta = -.61,
   CI: {[}-.89, -.34]) and mental health (beta = -.76, CI: {[}-1.07, -.45])
   dimensions of the health-related quality of life, respectively. Results
   also showed that preparedness moderated the relationship between burden
   and physical health (beta = .21, CI: {[}.11, .32]), as well as mental
   health (beta = .24, CI: {[}.12, .35]) dimensions. Ensuring that
   caregivers of stroke patients are adequately prepared to give care could
   ameliorate the negative impacts of caregiving on health of family
   caregivers of stroke patients.},

Title = {Caregiver Depression Among Home-Bound Stroke Patients in an Urban
   Community},
Journal = {CUREUS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Introduction
   The sudden undertaking of being a caregiver for a spouse or family
   member afflicted with a stroke can cause adverse psychological
   consequences. In Malaysia, the majority of stroke patients return home
   to be cared for by family members and continue rehabilitation as
   outpatients. In most local urban communities, the practice of shared
   caregiving is observed among stroke caregivers either out of necessity
   or familism. Sole or primary caregivers who share their homes with
   stroke patients would be more challenged physically and psychologically
   compared to secondary or joint caregivers. Sharing the caregiving
   responsibilities is believed to lighten the burden on primary
   caregivers. This study aims to determine the proportion and associated
   factors of depression among urban-dwelling caregivers of home-bound
   stroke patients receiving long-term care from a university-based primary
   care clinic.
   Methodology
   A cross-sectional study involving 123 primary and secondary caregivers
   of stroke patients was conducted at Klinik Primer PPUKM Cheras (KPPC)
   and the outpatient Medical Rehabilitation Services Department Hospital
   Canselor Tuanku Muhriz (HCTM), Cheras Kuala Lumpur. A self-administered
   questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic characteristics, the Beck
   Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Multidimensional Scale of
   Perceived Social Support questionnaire (MSPSS) was used. The functional
   status of the stroke patients was assessed using the Modified Rankin
   Score (MRS).
   Results
   The proportion of respondents with depression was 20.3\% (n=25).
   Depression was associated with caregivers' age (CI=42.23-50.09,
   p=0.016), presence of illness (p=0.001), and being a sole caregiver
   (p=0.001). There is also an association found between caregiver
   depression with longer duration post-stroke (CI= 12.75-16.13, p<0.001),
   longer time spent for caregiving (CI= 117.73-135.87, p=0.004), and more
   functionally dependant patients (p=0.002).
   Conclusion
   Depression affects one in five caregivers of home-bound stroke patients
   residing in the urban community. The primary care provider should be
   more vigilant in screening for depression, especially among caregivers
   who are from older age groups, have ongoing health problems, and are
   sole caregivers to patients who are functionally dependant.},

Abstract = {Although the overall incidence of stroke in the United States has
   decreased in recent years, the incidence of stroke among Black Americans
   has not changed. This has resulted in a widening gap between White and
   Black stroke survivors and their families. A variety of factors
   contribute to this inequity including social determinants of health
   (e.g., adverse life events, discrimination, neighborhood deprivation,
   lack of access to health care). This article uses a ``case and frame{''}
   approach, through the lens of ecological systems theory, to illustrate
   how social determinants of health express themselves in two stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyads living in a large Midwestern city. We draw out
   implications for practice and policy in social work and related
   disciplines that focus on recognizing the impact of social determinants
   of health, developing culturally-specific interventions that mitigate
   unique stressors but that also leverage unique strengths, and building
   capacity for cultural competence and cross-cultural health communication
   within organizations.},

Abstract = {Telemedicine implementation in ambulances can reduce time to treatment
   for stroke patients, which is important as ``time is brain{''} for these
   patients. Limited research has explored the demands placed on acute
   stroke caregivers in a telemedicine-integrated ambulance system. This
   study investigates the impact of telemedicine on workload, teamwork,
   workflow, and communication of geographically distributed caregivers
   delivering stroke care in ambulance-based telemedicine and usability of
   the system. Simulated stroke sessions were conducted with 27 caregivers,
   who subsequently completed a survey measuring workload, usability, and
   teamwork. Follow-up interviews with each caregiver ascertained how
   telemedicine affected workflow and demands which were analyzed for
   barriers and facilitators to using telemedicine. Caregivers experienced
   moderate workload and rated team effectiveness and usability high.
   Barriers included frustration with equipment and with the training of
   caregivers increasing demands, the loss of personal connection of the
   neurologists with the patients, and physical constraints in the
   ambulance. Facilitators were more common with live visual communication
   increasing teamwork and efficiency, the ease of access to neurologist,
   increased flexibility, and high overall satisfaction and usability.
   Future research should focus on eliminating these barriers and
   supporting the distributed cognition of caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose To understand the user expectations and the facilitators and
   barriers of using a virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic
   ({''}virtual clinic{''}). Methods A qualitative descriptive study
   involving two rounds of face-to-face semi-structured interviews per
   participant was conducted. We purposively recruited ten participants in
   Hong Kong who were receiving traditional stroke rehabilitation. The
   first interview was conducted to explore participants' expectations. The
   second interview was conducted after a 4-week trial of the virtual
   clinic. Both interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The
   findings were translated from Cantonese into English. Results Before
   using the virtual clinic, the participants perceived a need for (i)
   information communication technology guidance and support, (ii) familiar
   hardware and applications, and (iii) services to meet psychosocial
   needs. Facilitators identified by the participants included (i) feeling
   safe and supported, (ii) willingness to learn, adapt to, and use the new
   service, and (iii) ease of use with a flexible schedule. Issues relating
   to (i) internet connectivity, (ii) hardware, and (iii) interface and
   design were perceived barriers to the use of the clinic. Conclusion This
   study provides findings of users' expectations of using telehealth
   services. Their perspectives on facilitators and barriers may increase
   the adoption of the newly developed telehealth service.},

Abstract = {According to Lazarus and Folkman's theory, stress and coping affect an
   individual's anxiety, which is an adaptive outcome. This study examined
   the mediation effects of stress-coping strategies on the relationship
   between stress and anxiety in caregivers of patients with acute stroke.
   A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to analyze a total of 131
   caregivers caring for patients with acute stroke at a university
   hospital. The Caregivers Stress Scale, Ways of Coping Questionnaire, and
   Korean Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to quantify the participants'
   responses. Our results revealed that emotion-focused coping (beta = .56,
   p < .001) partially mediated the relationship between stress and anxiety
   (Z = 3.30, p < .001), suggesting its ability to exacerbate anxiety in
   the short term by acting as a mediator between stress and anxiety.
   Developing appropriate coping strategies for caregivers of patients with
   acute stroke is therefore critical for reducing their anxiety.},

Abstract = {AIM: This is a study protocol designed to evaluate the effect of
   transitional care model based interventions for patients with stroke and
   their caregivers on the caregivers' perceived competency, their
   preparedness for caregiving, increasing their electronic health
   literacy, reducing burnout, the rate of patients' hospital readmissions,
   and the frequency of pressure injuries.
   METHOD: The study protocol was planned as a randomized controlled trial
   with parallel arms. The study will include 70 patients with stroke and
   their caregivers. Multiple interventions (TEMpEST-Transitional Care
   Model Stroke Turkey), including at least 3 face-to-face interviews at
   the hospital, distance education via web, and telephone communications
   for 3 months, and 1 home visit within 7 days of discharge will be
   applied to the study group. The control arm will receive routine care.
   RESULTS: Findings will give after then when completed the study
   protocol.
   CONCLUSION: This study will evaluate the feasibility of interventions
   TEMpEST and its effect on patients with stroke and their caregivers.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a Two-Tier Family-Oriented Intervention in Enhancing
   the Family Functioning and Care Capacity of the Family Caregivers of
   Stroke Survivors: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Stroke has profound impacts on families. Often, family
   members, including stroke survivors and the person who takes up the role
   of the primary caregiver, would encounter demands on finances,
   rehabilitation arrangement, and even conflicts. Hence, a family-oriented
   intervention is expected to enable families to rebuild internal and
   external resources to achieve optimal rehabilitation and community
   reintegration.
   Objective: This study aims to describe a design of a two-tier
   family-oriented care management intervention for enhancing the family
   functioning and care capacity of the caregivers of stroke survivors.
   Methods: The two-tier care management intervention was guided by a
   standardized protocol conducted by trained professional care managers
   (first tier) with the support of trained volunteers (second tier), which
   lasted for 8-12 weeks. Participants were recruited through collaborating
   hospitals according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. In order to
   examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two-tier care
   management intervention, a two-arm randomization multicenter study was
   designed, including an active comparison group, which was guided by a
   standardized protocol conducted by trained volunteers. Dyadic
   participants, including both stroke survivors and their primary
   caregivers for both groups, were invited to participate in a
   questionnaire survey using standardized and purposefully developed
   measures 3 times: before the intervention, immediately after the
   intervention, and 2 months after the intervention. The primary outcome
   was family functioning measured by the Family Role Performance Scale and
   Family Assessment Device-General Functioning Scale. The secondary
   outcomes included caregiving burden, depressive symptoms, care
   management strategies, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
   Results: Recruitment began in January 2017 and was completed at the end
   of April 2019. Data collection was completed at the end of March 2020.
   As of March 2020, enrollment has been completed (n=264 stroke
   caregivers). A total of 200 participants completed the baseline
   questionnaires We aim to publish the results by mid-2021.
   Conclusions: This study successfully developed a two-tier care
   management protocol that aims to enhance the family functioning of the
   caregivers of stroke survivors. Guided by a standardized protocol, this
   family-oriented two-tier intervention protocol was found to be feasible
   among Chinese families.},

Abstract = {Background Outpatient medical follow-up post-stroke is not only crucial
   for secondary prevention but is also associated with a reduced risk of
   rehospitalization. However, being voluntary and non-urgent, it is
   potentially determined by both healthcare needs and the
   socio-demographic context of stroke survivor-caregiver dyads. Therefore,
   we aimed to examine the role of caregiver factors in outpatient medical
   follow-up (primary care (PC) and specialist outpatient care (SOC))
   post-stroke. Method Stroke survivors and caregivers from the Singapore
   Stroke Study, a prospective, yearlong, observational study, contributed
   to the study sample. Participants were interviewed 3-monthly for data
   collection. Counts of PC and SOC visits were extracted from the National
   Claims Database. Poisson modelling was used to explore the association
   of caregiver (and patient) factors with PC/SOC visits over 0-3 months
   (early) and 4-12 months (late) post-stroke. Results For the current
   analysis, 256 stroke survivors and caregivers were included. While
   caregiver-reported memory problems of a stroke survivor (IRR: 0.954;
   95\% CI: 0.919, 0.990) and caregiver burden (IRR: 0.976; 95\% CI: 0.959,
   0.993) were significantly associated with lower early post-stroke PC
   visits, co-residing caregiver (IRR: 1.576; 95\% CI: 1.040, 2.389) and
   negative care management strategies (IRR: 1.033; 95\% CI: 1.005, 1.061)
   were significantly associated with higher late post-stroke SOC visits.
   Conclusion We demonstrated that the association of caregiver factors
   with outpatient medical follow-up varied by the type of service (i.e.,
   PC versus SOC) and temporally. Our results support family-centred care
   provision by family physicians viewing caregivers not only as
   facilitators of care in the community but also as active members of the
   care team and as clients requiring care and regular assessments.},

Abstract = {Background: The purpose of the present study was to examine the internal
   consistency reliability and construct validity of the Caregiving Burden
   Instrument in Korean informal caregivers of stroke survivors. Methods: A
   descriptive survey design was used with a convenience sample of 208
   primary caregivers of stroke survivors. Internal consistency reliability
   was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Construct validity was
   assessed using exploratory and known-group analysis. Results: Each
   subscale and the total scale demonstrated satisfactory internal
   consistency reliability. Exploratory factor analysis identified five
   factors: family support, patient's dependency, physical health,
   financial burden, and psychological health, which together accounted for
   62.7\% of the variance. Known-group analysis indicated that caregivers
   with more than one year of experience reported significantly higher mean
   scores for the total burden score and its five subscales compared to
   those with less than one year. Conclusions: This 23-item instrument
   demonstrates good internal consistency reliability and construct
   validity. The tool can be used to effectively assess burden in
   caregivers of stroke survivors and the data obtained can form the basis
   for the development of family interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: The study's main goal has been to investigate the social
   representations of stroke patients' family caregivers by focusing on
   self-care. Methods: It is a descriptive study, which used the
   theoretical approach of social representations. There were investigated
   20 caregivers who attended two specialized clinics in Belem city, Para
   State, Brazil. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews
   and processed by the inductive thematic analysis technique. Results:
   Self-care was represented by caregivers as difficult to combine to their
   activities of caring for the person suffering from stroke due to work
   overload, which generated stress and frustration. Some caregivers were
   able to transform this stress into a representation belonging to a
   complexity of their experience and the care reality. Conclusion: It was
   possible to access their social imagery and, consequently, the
   production of linked meanings as caregivers' actions, behaviors and
   cognitive components involved in the care reality.},

Journal = {REVISTA LATINO-AMERICANA DE ENFERMAGEM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Objective: to analyze the effectiveness of a support intervention on the
   burden and stress of family caregivers and on the stroke survivors'
   independence level, compared to the Control Group. Method: a
   quasi-experimental study conducted with 37 participants (Intervention
   Group, n=20; and Control Group, n=17). The intervention lasted 8 months.
   The outcomes of the caregivers (burden and stress) and of the survivors
   (independence level) were measured by the Zarit, Perceived Stress and
   Katz scales, at the following moments: pre-intervention, the fourth
   month of the intervention and post-intervention. The differences of
   these outcomes between groups and intra-group and the effect size were
   calculated using the Mann-Whitney and Friedman tests (Bonferroni
   adjustment by Wilcoxon) and the Kendall's W coefficient. Results: the
   Intervention Group reduced burden ( p=0.039) and stress (p=0.009),
   mainly, after 8 months of intervention, which was not observed in the
   Control Group. The independence level did not change between the groups
   or moments (p>0.05). The intervention presented moderate effect size
   (p=0.45 and p=0.54). Conclusion: the intervention was effective to
   reduce the burden and stress of family caregivers, but did not alter the
   stroke survivors' independence level, when compared to the Control
   Group.},

Title = {Effect of cognitive behavior intervention on life quality of patients
   with stroke and the caregiving burden on their caregivers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {117-126},
Abstract = {To determine the effect of cognitive behavior intervention on the life
   quality of patients with stroke and the caregiving burden of their
   caregivers. A total of 200 patients with stroke who were treated in
   Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2017 to January 2019
   were enrolled and divided into two different patient groups according to
   the nursing mode (each n = 100), and the 200 corresponding caregivers of
   the patients with stroke were selected, and assigned to an observation
   group and a control group (each n = 100). Patients in the observation
   group were given cognitive behavior intervention, while those in the
   control group were given routine nursing. The limb recovery (Fugl-Meyer
   Assessment (FMA) score and Barthel index) and neurological function
   (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and
   Scandinavian stroke scale (SSS)) of the patients were evaluated, and the
   caregiving burden score (Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) score) and
   positive feelings (positive aspects of caregiving (PAC)) of the
   caregivers were evaluated. In addition, the life quality, anxiety, and
   depression of the patients and caregivers were monitored and evaluated
   using the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), self-rating
   anxiety scale (SAS), and self-rating depression scale (SDS). Patients in
   the observation group had higher FMA scores and Barthel Index and lower
   NIHSS scores and SSS scores than the control group, and they also had
   lower caregiving burden scores and higher positive feeling scores, and
   had higher life quality scores and lower SAS and SDS scores than the
   control group. Cognitive behavior intervention has positive effect on
   patients with stroke, because it can significantly improve the life
   quality of patients and their caregivers, and lower the caregiving
   burden of the caregivers. Therefore, it is worthy of clinical promotion.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. To describe the perspective of nurses about the difficulties
   reported by Informal caregivers of older stroke survivors.
   METHOD. Qualitative and descriptive study using the focus group
   technique. Nine nurses who work In different community health units
   participated in this study. The content of earn session was recorded In
   audio to facilitate Its transcription and analysis. Data analysis was
   performed using NVIVO10 software.
   RESULTS. Seven typologies emerged by similarity: capacity to feed/drink;
   capacity to feed/hydrate through nasogastric tube; capacity to care of
   personal hygiene; capacity to use the toilet; capacity to dress/undress:
   capacity to transfer; capacity to maintain posture.
   CONCLUSIONS. Nurses should support families in the acqulsition of
   knowledge and practical skills, the resolution of daily challenges and
   problems, and in the management of resources and emotional needs of the
   person cared in order to prevent negative consequences assocated with
   care provision. An adequate health Education would allow not only to
   improve knowledge and skills in informal caregivers, but also to help
   them cope with the new situation and be able to accept the
   new-condition. Therefore, care would be more effective, improving the
   quality of life for both dependent older stroke survivors and
   caregivers.},

Title = {Figuring it out by yourself: Perceptions of home-based care of stroke
   survivors, family caregivers and community health workers in a
   low-resourced setting, South Africa},

Abstract = {Background: In less resourced settings, formal rehabilitation services
   for stroke survivors were often absent. Stroke survivors were referred
   to community health workers (CHWs) who were untrained in rehabilitation.
   Aim: To describe the experience and perceived needs of stroke survivors,
   their caregivers and CHWs in a context with limited access to and
   support from formal rehabilitation services.
   Setting: The Breede Valley subdistrict, Western Cape, South Africa, a
   rural, less resourced setting.
   Methods: A descriptive exploratory qualitative study. Four focus group
   interviews were held with purposively selected stroke survivors and
   caregivers and four with CHWs. A thematic approach and the framework
   method were used to analyse the transcripts.
   Findings: A total of 41 CHWs, 21 caregivers and 26 stroke survivors
   participated. Four main themes and 11 sub-themes were identified.
   Because of the lack of knowledge, training and rehabilitation services,
   the main theme for all groups was having to `figure things out'
   independently, with incontinence management being particularly
   challenging. Secondly was the need for emotional support for stroke
   survivors and caregivers. Thirdly, contextual factors such as
   architectural barriers and lack of assistive products negatively
   impacted care and function. Lastly, the organisation of health and
   rehabilitation services negatively impacted home-based services and
   professional support.
   Conclusions: With appropriate training, the CHWs can be pivotal in the
   training and support of family caregivers and stroke survivors. Care
   pathways and the role and scope of both CHWs and therapists in
   home-based stroke rehabilitation should be defined and restructured,
   including the links with formal services.},

Abstract = {Stroke survivors and their caregivers report not receiving enough
   information at discharge. To identify strengths and weaknesses of stroke
   discharge education, we delivered questionnaires that assessed patient
   and caregiver recall, perceived utility, and satisfaction at discharge
   as well as 1- and 3-month follow-up. Categorical data of responses were
   compared between time periods using Fischer exact test. Recall
   significantly differed between discharge (86\%) and 1-month follow-up
   (54\%, P < .05), but not discharge and 3-month follow-up (69\%). Patient
   perceived utility at both 1 month (69\%) and 3 months (64\%) was lower
   than at discharge (92\%, P < .05). Patient satisfaction was lower at 1
   month (69\%) and 3 months (54\%) than discharge (92\%, P < .05).
   Caregiver recall declined from discharge (81\%) to 1 month (65\%) but
   improved from 1 to 3 months (82\%, P < .05). Caregiver satisfaction and
   perceived utility remained positive through the study. The results
   suggest stroke patients and their caregivers suffer from education
   recall failure over time that is associated with worse satisfaction and
   perceived utility by patients. Reinforcement at 1 month may improve
   caregiver recall. We conclude that education for caregivers may be more
   reliably reinforced, suggesting a role in continued patient education.},

Abstract = {Context: Aphasia is a major disabling condition after a stroke that
   profoundly affects the quality of life of stroke survivors (SS) and
   their caregivers. Comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation has
   emerged as a complementary intervention that helps in improving the
   associated cognitive and psychological deficits and quality of life
   following a brain injury. A standardized, simple, and easy to administer
   intervention that can be delivered as a home-based intervention can
   assist in faster recovery. Aims: To describe the development,
   validation, and feasibility of a home-based, caregiver-delivered
   comprehensive neuropsychological and language rehabilitation for SS.
   Methods and Material: A culture-specific picture and task-based 8-week
   training workbook and manual were developed based on extensive review
   and focused group discussions. This intervention targeted areas of
   language (comprehension, fluency, and naming) and cognition (working
   memory, attention and concentration, executive functioning, and response
   inhibition). It was standardized on 40 healthy controls (HC) and 15 SS.
   Before recruitment, written informed consent was obtained from each
   patient, their primary caregiver, and the HCs. Results: All tasks were
   found to be effective in discriminating the performance of SS from the
   HC. The performance of the HC with respect to the errors and the time
   taken for each task was used for the hierarchical arrangement of the
   tasks. The developed intervention was later validated on 15 SS where
   they significantly improved in the pre-post assessment of language
   functioning (P < 0.001), quality of life (P < 0.001), and depression (P
   < 0.001). Conclusions: This intervention can be feasible to administer
   as a home-based intervention and may help to alleviate language and
   neuropsychological complaints after stroke in low-literate or
   mixed-cultural populations. Further, large sample size studies are
   recommended.},

Abstract = {Evidence-based models are critical for understanding caregiver
   well-being and treatment interventions from a holistic perspective. This
   study introduces the Indivisible Self: An Evidence-Based Model of
   Wellness (IS-WEL) as a means for examining the holistic wellness of
   pediatric stroke caregivers. In this exploratory study, 161 participants
   completed a demographic survey and the Five-Factor Wellness Inventory
   (FF-WEL). Results indicate significant wellness score differences
   between the current sample of pediatric stroke caregivers and the FF-WEL
   norming sample on the higher orderTotal Wellnessfactor, the second-order
   wellness factors ofCreative SelfandSocial Self, and the third-order
   wellness factors ofthinking, emotions, control, positive humor, andlove.
   These results support the veracity of the IS-WEL as an additional
   empirically sound holistic approach for understanding and addressing the
   well-being of stroke caregivers. The authors discuss practical clinical
   and research implications for utilizing the IS-WEL with pediatric stroke
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The brutal occurrence of a stroke upsets the life of a
   parent, within his or her family and circle of friends.
   Context: The lack of medical-social interventions and support from a
   health professional for parents who have suffered a stroke forces family
   caregivers to provide care for their parents. The aim of this study is
   to describe and understand the subjective lived experience of family
   caregivers of stroke patients in such a context.
   Method: Using a clinical method and interpretative phenomenological
   analysis, eight clinical interviews were conducted at home with four
   family caregivers (two interviews per caregiver) from two separate
   families (two caregivers per family), recruited at the neurology unit in
   the internal medicine department at Yaounde military hospital.
   Results: Throughout the whole care process, family caregivers have a
   difficult experience, with painful affects and psychological fatigue.
   They are forced into subjugation by unconscious alliances through the
   quality of the bond they have with the parent who has had the stroke.
   The strengthening of this bond enables them to avoid the risk of
   psychological and relational collapse.},

Title = {Factors associated with suicidal ideation in caregivers of stroke
   survivors},
Journal = {REV RENE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Abstract = {Objective: to identify factors associated with the presence of suicidal
   ideation in caregivers of stroke survivors. Methods: cross-sectional
   survey conducted with 151 primary informal caregivers. The Depression
   Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and a questionnaire were used to evaluate
   the presence of thoughts of suicidal ideation, whose data were analyzed
   by descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: most caregivers had
   normal levels of depression (76.8\%), anxiety (76.2\%) and stress
   (79.5\%), and showed no thoughts of suicidal ideation (70.9\%). The
   correlation between scales showed that thoughts of suicidal ideation
   rise proportionally to the increase of anxiety, depression and stress
   levels. Conclusion: it was observed that high levels of depression,
   anxiety and stress favored the increased frequency of suicidal thoughts
   among caregivers of stroke survivors.},

   structured in the following areas: Disease Guidelines; Emotional
   Support; Using the Health Care Network; Diet; Airways; Medications;
   Hygiene; Skin Care; Disposal; Dressing/Undressing; Positioning and
   Transfer; Fall Prevention. In the pretest, eight experts assessed
   protocol clarity and content. In validation, there were two rounds by
   the Delphi Technique. The validated protocol consisted of 12 domains,
   containing 42 items and 240 care guidelines. Conclusion: the protocol
   qualifies the transition of care after hospital discharge assisting
   nurses in home care practice.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: The Portuguese instrument for informal
   caregivers' skills providing care of aged people after a stroke
   (ECPICID-AVC) evaluates the capacities that informal caregivers must
   have for supporting aged stroke survivors. The purpose was to adapt and
   validate the ECPICID-AVC to be used in Brazil. Methods: A methodological
   study was conducted. Results: The terms with the lowest degree of
   comprehension were adapted. The factor analysis suggested the exclusion
   of three items and that the remaining be grouped into six domains. The
   factor loadings varied from 0.525 to 0.924. The internal intra-assessor
   consistency was satisfactory (ICC = 0.94, CI 95\%). Total reliability
   was considered excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.914). Conclusions: The
   ECPICID-AVC is considered appropriate for using in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is a major global health problem and second leading
   cause of death worldwide. In India, the incidence of stroke rate has
   increased from 56/100,000 person to 117/100,000 person. Stroke
   rehabilitation is an active process and begins during acute
   hospitalisation. Stroke survivors may return to an active and productive
   lifestyle through rehabilitation.
   Aim: To determine the effectiveness of Structured Teaching Programme
   (STP) on the knowledge about rehabilitation of stroke patients among
   caregivers.
   Materials and Methods: A pre-experimental pre-test, post-test research
   design was used to conduct this study. Purposive sampling was the
   sampling method used to collect data from family caregivers of stroke
   survivors on the basis of semi-structured interview schedule. After
   collecting pre-test data, STP was organised for intervention of stroke
   rehabilitation to samples. Seven days were provided to the samples for
   utilising STP which was organised for 45-50 minutes through lecture,
   discussion and planned Audio-Visual (AV) aids. Post-test information was
   gathered after seven days from the day of teaching intervention. Seven
   days was assigned after getting expert opinions as well as to give time
   for implication of knowledge through practice of stroke rehabilitation.
   The sample characteristics were described by frequency, percentage and
   t-test was used to describe the difference between pre-test and
   post-test knowledge score. Chi-square test was also used to find out the
   association between knowledge of caregivers regarding stroke
   rehabilitations and selected demographic variables.
   Results: The mean pre-test knowledge score was 9.76 and mean post-test
   knowledge score was 14.7. There was a statistically significant
   improvement in the level of knowledge regarding stroke rehabilitations
   among caregivers (t(0.001.29) =3.659) and no association was found
   between pre-test knowledge level and selected demographic variables.
   Conclusion: The demand of stroke rehabilitation by involving family
   caregivers is increasing as it will help stroke patient to improve
   activity of daily livings as well as decrease disability and prevent
   complications.},

Abstract = {With stroke being one of the leading causes of disability worldwide,
   families and social systems may face strain as they adjust to a
   caregiving role. This strain may be amplified in family systems living
   in rural areas due to limited access to resources. Thus, it is important
   for helping professionals such as couple, marriage, and family
   therapists to understand what facets of this disability are linked with
   caregiver strain as well as to explore and understand various
   interventions that may ease caregiver burden. Using existing data from
   177 pairs of stroke patients and their family caregivers in rural
   Mainland China, the present study utilized a moderation analysis to
   examine (1) the association between stroke patient physical functioning,
   patient mental health, and their family caregiver burden and (2) how a
   developed patient rehabilitation intervention program for caregivers
   moderated the association between patient physical functioning as well
   as mental health and caregiver burden 6-month post intervention. Results
   suggested that better patient physical functioning were related to lower
   levels of caregiver burden (b = - 1.418, p < .001, beta = - 0.33).
   However, the developed rehabilitation intervention program did not
   significantly moderate the association between stroke patient physical
   functioning as well as mental health and caregiver burden. These
   findings provide insight into correlates of stroke patient's caregiver
   burden in rural China. Development of more effective rehabilitation
   programs and interventions for stroke patients and their family
   caregivers as well how couple, marriage, and family therapists may be
   uniquely qualified to contribute to such interventions is discussed.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe relationships between the ECPICID-AVC scale
   factors and the NANDA-I domains, classes, and Nursing Diagnoses (NDs).
   Method: Cross-mapping study between the NANDA-I taxonomy and ECPICID-AVC
   scale was constructed based on the eight ECPICID-AVC scale factors and
   the 13 NANDA-I domains. A descriptive analysis was performed to present
   the mapped elements. Results: Areas of similarity and intersection were
   found between the eight ECPICID-AVC factors and nine NANDA-I domains, 19
   classes, and 72 NDs. All scale factors were mapped with the Domain
   1/Health Promotion, Class 2/Health Management and the ND ``Frail elderly
   syndrome{''}. Final considerations:The ECPICID-AVC scale factors were
   mapped with nine domains, their classes and diagnoses. This study
   demonstrates the importance of identifying nursing diagnoses and their
   relationship with factors that evaluate caregiving capacity. The
   ECPICID-AVC can help nurses generate nursing diagnoses regarding the
   caregiver's needs and their capacities related to care to focus such
   needs.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   The aim of the study was to determine the level of knowledge about
   stroke among caregivers of patients hospitalized for stroke at the
   Cocody's university hospital (Abidjan).
   Method
   It was a cross-sectional study, carried out during a three months
   period, from 2nd April to 2nd July 2018 at the Cocody's university
   hospital.
   Through a questionnaire, we assessed knowledges, perceptions and
   behaviors of stroke patients's caregivers. We also intended to determine
   their knowledge level of risk factors and signs or symptoms of stroke.
   Results
   The study included 106 caregivers, from the entourage of stroke patients
   staying in hospital. The caregivers mean age was 40.18 +/- 13.09 years.
   The percentage of unschooled caregivers was 20.80\%. The acronym `` AVC
   `` was correctly defined by 12 caregivers (11.30\%). Half of
   participants estimated that stroke had a mystical origin, and 57.50\%
   identified `` spells `` as risk factors for stroke. Hypertension was the
   main risk factor of stroke spontaneously cited by 40.57\% of caregivers.
   The most commonly reported signs of stroke were hemiplegia and language
   impairment, reported by 78.30\% and 37.74\% of caregivers, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Our study found that knowledge of risk factors, symptoms, and ways to
   prevent stroke are inadequate.},

Abstract = {To analyze stroke patients' and the caregivers' satisfaction with
   environmental management as well as the mutual influence mechanism.
   General hospitals and community medical institutions in Shanghai City
   were randomly sampled 600 pairs of stroke inpatients and the caregivers
   for the questionnaire survey during January - June, 2016, and 575 pairs
   were eventually received. The ``Actor-Partner Interdependence{''} model
   (APIM) was constructed to study the mutual influence of two
   interdependence variables on the satisfaction with environmental
   management. Patients' age and caregivers' education level showed
   significant effects on patients' and the caregivers' satisfaction with
   environmental management (influence coefficients {[}beta=-0.10 and
   {[}3=0.08, respectively). In other words, the higher patients' age and
   the lower caregivers' education level revealed the lower satisfaction
   with environmental management. Patients' self-care degree at admission
   presented remarkably positive effects on their and the caregivers'
   satisfaction with environmental management (influence coefficients
   {[}beta=0.11 and {[}beta=0.07, respectively). In other words, the higher
   patients' self-care at admission would enhance the satisfaction with
   environmental management and caregivers' satisfaction with environmental
   management. Besides, the influence coefficient of the former was higher
   than it of the latter (beta=0.11>beta=0.07). Patients' length of stays
   merely appeared notably negative effects on the satisfaction with
   environmental management (influence coefficient {[}beta=-0.02). Both
   patients' and the caregivers' satisfaction with inpatient service showed
   significantly negative effects on the satisfaction with environmental
   management (beta=-0.33 and {[}beta=-0.16, respectively). In this case,
   the higher patients' and the caregivers' satisfaction with inpatient
   service appeared the higher satisfaction with environmental management.
   Besides, the influence coefficient of the former is higher than it of
   the latter (beta=0.33>beta=0.16). Medical staff and health decision
   makers could apply correspondent measures, enhance individual
   satisfaction with inpatient service by taking the combination of
   individual characteristics and disease characteristics of the two into
   account, and eventually promote stroke patients' satisfaction with
   environmental management.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Caregiving for stroke patients is a challenging task both
   emotionally and physically. Studies have shown that caregiving can
   affect caregivers' wellbeing that could lead to depression. Objective:
   This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and associated
   risk factors of depression amongst caregivers of stroke patients
   attending Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) in Kelantan over a 6
   month period. Methodology: This is a cross sectional study at the
   primary care clinic in HUSM over a period of 6 months. A total of 116
   caregivers of medically documented stroke patients who fulfilled the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited via convenience
   sampling. The brief patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to
   assess their depression. Descriptive statistics and bivariable analysis
   was used using SPSS version 23. Results: 63.8\% of the caregivers of
   stroke patients are depressed. Caregiver's burden, ethnicity and
   patient's ethnicity were found to be significant associated risk factors
   for depression. Conclusion: Screening for depression in caregivers
   especially those with risk factors must be carried out in the clinic in
   order to detect and intervene early. Coping mechanisms especially in the
   religious aspect should be elicited in future studies.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability in adults and the
   second leading cause of dementia. After the hospitalization phase, the
   return to the patient's home is closely linked to the caregiver's
   burden. The aim of our study was to assess the burden of the primary
   caregiver of stroke patients after returning home.
   Method
   This was a longitudinal study carried out from 1st October 2014 to 30th
   September 2015 at the university hospital of Brazzaville. All patients
   hospitalized for a first stroke confirmed by brain imaging and returned
   to their homes were included. All patients with a modified Rankin Scale
   >= 2 prior to hospitalization were not included. The Zarit scale was
   used to assess the caregiver's burden. The other variables studied
   included socio-demographic data from patients and caregivers, the
   psychological and physical impact of patients' vascular hemiplegia,
   assessed respectively by abbreviated Beck's questionnaire and the
   Barthel index. The SPSS 21 software was used for statistical analysis.
   The significance threshold was set at 0.05.
   Results
   The study included 70 patients with a mean age of 55.4 +/- 11.49 years,
   with a sex ratio of 1.12. The primary caregiver was represented by a
   descendant in 44.5\%. The mean age of caregivers was 41.4 +/- 11.9
   years, significantly lower than that of the patients (p <0.001). The
   average Zarit score was 44.8 +/- 10.6; 36.4 +/- 12.1 and 27.2 +/- 13.8
   respectively at one, three and six months of follow-up. The caregiver
   burden improved over time, with an average change in the Zarit score
   between the first and the sixth month of statistically significant
   follow-up of -17.6 +/- 8.16 (p <0.001). Patient age ``over 65 years{''},
   ``spousal{''} lifestyle, and ``haemorrhagic{''} stroke were identified
   as factors associated with the caregiver's burden.
   Conclusion
   The burden of neurological disability after a stroke on the primary
   caregiver improves as the course progresses, with improved functional
   autonomy and improved patient mood. It is necessary to include this data
   in the therapeutic education of caregivers in the context of
   comprehensive care for stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Aim: This paper presents the pilot project ``The Caregivers' Guide{''},
   which is financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and
   Research (BMBF). The project's concept is outreach-oriented and
   personal, giving constant support to relatives of stroke patients
   throughout rehabilitation. Its effects were reviewed in an accompanying
   study.
   Method: A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was chosen
   to gather data on the experiences and assessments of the caregivers, as
   well as changes during the counselling process. 62 caregivers completed
   questionnaires before and after the intervention. Additionally, 30
   qualitative interviews were carried out.
   Results: Positive effects could be observed in accordance with the
   project goals, especially regarding provision of appropriate
   information, burden reduction and strengthening clients' resources. The
   accompaniment by a fixed reference person was viewed as helpful, the
   combination of professional knowledge and emotional support was deemed
   most essential.
   Discussion: The concept ``The Caregivers' Guide{''} is suitable as an
   impetus of innovation regarding the development of counseling structures
   for family caregivers.},

Abstract = {Aim: The purpose of this phenomenological study is to contribute to the
   literature surrounding caregivers of persons with stroke and to
   understand the caregivers' perspective on leisure participation and
   quality of life. Methods' Caregivers (n = 4) of clients with stroke were
   recruited for they study via convenience sampling. Participants were
   audio-recorded during a semi-structured interview lasting 60-80 minutes.
   The interview guide included open-ended questions about the
   participant's leisure participation and quality of life. Recorded data
   was transcribed and in-vivo coding was completed. Results: Eight
   categories were developed from the identified codes and narrowed into
   primary themes: role shift, loss of control, and occupational
   deprivation, consistent with Moustakas (1994) as adapted by Creswell
   (2013). Conclusions: Understanding the essence of the lived experience
   of caregivers is important to the occupational therapy profession
   because of the prevalence of caregiver burden and the impact such
   roleransition has on their occupational participation and that of the
   client.},

   through an Occupational Therapy Lens},
Journal = {INTERNET JOURNAL OF ALLIED HEALTH SCIENCES AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the occupational
   needs of caregivers of stroke survivors and to identify potential
   implications for occupational therapy's role with this population.
   Methods: Focus groups and a semi-structured interview were used to
   gather an in-depth perspective on caregivers' needs and level of
   participation in valued activities. Interactions were recorded and
   transcribed verbatim. Data analysis included open coding, formulation of
   categorical patterns, and thematic analysis. Rigor was enhanced through
   peer review, multiple coders, member checking, and triangulation.
   Results: Four primary themes emerged: (1) the essential need for
   additional services and support; (2) the amount of time spent on
   addressing spouses' needs resulted in occupational loss; (3) finding new
   ways to participate in daily life activities; and, (4) an association
   between the survivor's level of impairment and the caregiver's quality
   of life. Conclusion: Demands of caregiving can lead to changes in roles,
   responsibilities, and routines. Occupational therapy practitioners are
   uniquely qualified to reinstate valued occupations into daily life,
   formulate balanced routines, and provide client specific supports and
   resources. Occupational therapy services could provide strategies to
   enhance caregivers' ability to partake in meaningful occupations and
   resume a balanced lifestyle. More research is needed to determine the
   occupational needs of caregivers and the effectiveness of caregiver
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: To quantify the availability of informal caregivers in
   surviving stroke patients residing at home in Belgium.
   Methods: National estimates on the availability of informal caregivers
   were made using data from a nationwide observational registration of
   family physicians working in sentinel practices and a nationwide
   administrative database for reimbursement of hospitals in Belgium.
   Results: A total of 189 Belgian family physicians (FPs) from 141
   practices participated in the study and recorded 326 patients (144 men
   and 182 women) with stroke. These FPs reach 1.5\% of the Belgian
   population. After 1 month, 71\% of the male and 75\% of the female
   stroke survivors received support from family caregivers (p = 0.547).
   After 6 months, the percentage of male patients who received support
   from family caregivers decreased to 60\% compared with 75\% in female (p
   = 0.038). Of all patients with stroke admitted to Belgian hospitals
   during the reference year 2009 (n = 16.437), 8.997 returned home. Based
   on the findings from the sentinel practices, it is estimated that a mean
   of 73\% (n = 6.568) and 67.5\% (n = 6.073) of surviving patients with
   stroke can rely on informal caregivers in their home setting after one
   and 6 months, respectively.
   Conclusions: A vast majority of surviving stroke patients in Belgium can
   rely on informal caregivers in their home setting, but their
   availability rapidly decreases 6 months after the event. These findings
   underline the importance of proactive health policy making in stroke
   care taking into account the potentially decreasing number of available
   informal caregivers in the decades to come.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the psychological burden of caregivers of
   patients with stroke. METHOD Cross-sectional study of 106 caregivers of
   patients who had suffered a stroke at least one month before the survey.
   The data were collected from the caregivers of patients hospitalized in
   3 public hospitals in Attica, using a questionnaire that included
   questions about the clinical characteristics of the patients and the
   demographic characteristics of the caregivers, who also completed scales
   measuring psychological burden, sense of coherence-cohesion, positive
   meaning (benefit finding) and anxiety and depression. RESULTS Twenty of
   the caregivers were males (18.9\%) and 86 females (81.1\%). Caregiver
   anxiety and depression were found to be positively related to all
   dimensions of caregiver burden (disappointment, general strain,
   isolation, environment, emotional involvement). A high sense of
   coherence (meaningfulness, manageability, comprehensibility) was
   significantly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms in the
   caregivers. The age of the caregiver was positively associated with
   benefit finding (acceptance). Higher levels of overall caregiver burden,
   older age of the caregiver, greater emotional attachment to the patient,
   and lower levels of comprehensibility were related to a higher degree of
   depressive symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS Taking care of patients with
   stroke is associated with a heavy psychological burden and psychological
   morbidity in the caregivers, in the form of depressive symptoms. Issues
   of family members taking care of a close relative suffering from stroke
   are raised by these findings.},

Volume = {67},

Pages = {4-8},
Abstract = {Recovery after stroke is often incomplete and many stroke survivors
   depend on family caregivers. The demands of caring can negatively impact
   quality of life of these carers. This study explores levels of strain
   experienced by caregivers and the variables that impact on their strain.
   A concurrent, mixed method, descriptive design was utilized. Fifty-seven
   caregivers of stroke survivors who received rehabilitation at the
   Western Cape Rehabilitation Centre participated in the study. The
   Barthel Index and Caregiver Strain Index were utilised to collect
   quantitative data, which was statistically analysed (p < 0.05).
   Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews and
   thematically analysed.
   Fifty eight percent of caregivers were experiencing high levels of
   strain. The following variables significantly impacted on strain namely,
   caregiver loss of employment (0.04), emotional pressure (0.01), patient
   residual cognitive and perceptual impairments (0.01), personality
   changes (0.01) and physical dependency (0.0012). According to the
   qualitative data the burden was aggravated by financial problems,
   patient perceptual problems and patient personality changes. The
   findings indicate the need for support after discharge, ongoing
   community support and respite care to enable time off for caregivers.},

Abstract = {Stroke rehabilitation, especially for patients with sequelae, lacks
   practicable rehabilitation training methods. Using the convenience
   sampling method, self-care ability in 60 stroke patients was
   investigated for 6 months to 2 years post-stroke (sequelae stage), as
   well as the capability of primary caregivers selected from two
   communities in Shanghai, China. Influential factors were analyzed.
   Results demonstrated that only 37\% of stroke patients exhibited strong
   self-care ability, and 43\% of primary caregivers provided high levels
   of care. Results also demonstrated that self-care ability in stroke
   patients, as well as the capability of primary caregivers, should be
   improved. A total of 47\% of stroke patients participated in community

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the impact of active training ({''}handson
   training{''}) caregivers on their attitudes for handling the patients
   and to examine the effectiveness of hands-on training in improving
   psychosocial outcomes for stroke patients and their caregivers.
   Method: The subjects were 59 stroke patients and their family
   caregivers. They were randomly divided into two groups: a control group
   and a training group. The training group received active hands-on
   training about personal care with handling techniques. We collected the
   data through interviewing the patients and their caregivers on admission
   and at discharge. The stroke patients and caregivers were evaluated with
   the functional status, caregiver appraisal scale, psychological state,
   quality of life.
   Results: Caregivers in the training group experienced a significant
   reduction in caregiving burden and anxiety (p < 0.05). There were no
   differences in depression or physical health between the two groups,
   although caregivers in the intervention group were found to have
   significantly better mental health. Patients in the caregiver training
   group also experienced less anxiety and better mental health (p < 0.05),
   and had a modest benefit in functional status (independence in
   activities of daily living) (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: A hands-on training for caregivers of post-stroke inpatients
   resulted in reducing burden of care and anxiety while improving
   psychosocial outcomes for caregivers, proving that the hands-on training
   might be helpful in caregivers of stroke inpatients.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the problematic aspects of the
   families of people who were hospitalized because of strokes, and discuss
   the difficulties of the family caregiver toward household care. The
   sample consisted of 154 families of patients admitted in a public
   hospital in Fortaleza, Ceara state, Brazil. The results showed that most
   caregivers are women, 104 (67.5\%); 122 cases (79.2\%) showed family
   commitment and changes in the daily life of 115 accompanying partners
   (74.7\%); 150 (97.4\%) were not instructed about the care, but 143
   (92.9\%) felt safe to provide care. The predominant feeling was sadness,
   in 125 (81.2\%) of the subjects, and the main doubts were: eating
   habits, 64 (41.6\%); administering medication, 49 (29.9\%); and possible
   clinical complications after discharge, 49 (29.9\%). These results are
   worth noting for the nurse's role as an educator, not only regarding the
   prevention of chronic-degenerative diseases, but also concerning
   delivering instructions to family caregivers about providing care after
   hospital discharge.},

Abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of people in developing countries who
   suffer strokes, the long-term care of people who have had a stroke and
   who are living with disabilities has substantial consequences for
   caregivers and their respective families. As the caregiver plays a
   pivotal role in the rehabilitation of the people who have had a stroke,
   the objectives of this study constitute an investigation into the
   complexities of caregiving, including both perceptions and experiences
   of the healthcare system. Semi-structured interviews were utilised to
   elicit post-stroke experiences of six caregivers. The challenge the
   South African context adds to these experiences was probed. The data
   were analysed qualitatively by thematic and content analysis. Prominent
   themes associated with caregiving included: role changes and
   relationship disruptions within the family, occupational and social
   implications, fatigue, anxiety, depression, loneliness, frustration as
   well as financial problems. Caregiver experiences were exacerbated by
   the inadequate support structures available. The results are interpreted
   within a biopsychosocial approach, concluding with the concerns raised
   by caregivers on the support they require from the healthcare system in
   order to provide home-based care.},
