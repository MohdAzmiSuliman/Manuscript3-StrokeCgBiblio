1,DETERMINANTS OF CAREGIVING BURDEN AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CAREGIVERS OF STROKE PATIENTS,MCCULLAGH E;BRIGSTOCKE G;DONALDSON N;KALRA L,10.1161/01.STR.0000181755.23914.53,277,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - A LARGE PROPORTION OF DISABLED STROKE SURVIVORS LIVE AT HOME AND ARE SUPPORTED BY INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. IDENTIFICATION OF DETERMINANTS OF CAREGIVER BURDEN WILL HELP TO TARGET CAREGIVER INTERVENTIONS. METHODS - DATA ON PATIENT, CAREGIVER, AND HEALTH AND SOCIAL SUPPORT CHARACTERISTICS WERE COLLECTED PROSPECTIVELY OVER 1 YEAR IN 232 STROKE SURVIVORS IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF CAREGIVER TRAINING. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE VARIABLES TO CAREGIVER BURDEN SCORE (CBS) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) MEASURES AT 3 MONTHS AND 1 YEAR WAS ANALYZED USING REGRESSION MODELS. RESULTS - STROKE PATIENTS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 74 +/- 11 YEARS, AND 120 (52\%) WERE MEN. THE MEAN AGE OF CAREGIVERS WAS 65.7 +/- 12.5 YEARS, 149 (64\%) WERE FEMALES, AND 116 (50\%) HAD RECEIVED CAREGIVER TRAINING. THE MEAN CBS WAS 48 +/- 13 AND 38 +/- 11 (SCORE RANGE OF BAD TO GOOD 88 TO 22) AND QOL SCORE WAS 75 +/- 16 AND 75 +/- 15 (SCORE RANGE OF BAD TO GOOD 0 TO 100) AT 3 MONTHS AND 1 YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. CBS AND QOL CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH PATIENT (AGE, DEPENDENCY, AND MOOD), CAREGIVER (AGE, GENDER, MOOD, AND TRAINING), AND SUPPORT (SOCIAL SERVICES AND FAMILY NETWORKS) VARIABLES. OF THESE, ONLY PATIENT AND CAREGIVER EMOTIONAL STATUS, CAREGIVER AGE AND GENDER, AND PARTICIPATION IN CAREGIVER TRAINING WERE INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF EITHER OUTCOME AT 3 MONTHS. PATIENT DEPENDENCY AND FAMILY SUPPORT WERE ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS AT 1 YEAR. SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORT PREDICTED INSTITUTIONALIZATION BUT NOT CAREGIVER OUTCOMES. CONCLUSION - ADVANCING AGE AND ANXIETY IN PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS, HIGH DEPENDENCY, AND POOR FAMILY SUPPORT IDENTIFY CAREGIVERS AT RISK OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES, WHICH MAY BE REDUCED BY CAREGIVER TRAINING."
2,CAREGIVER'S BURDEN OF PATIENTS 3 YEARS AFTER STROKE ASSESSED BY A NOVEL CAREGIVER BURDEN SCALE,ELMSTAHL S;MALMBERG B;ANNERSTEDT L,10.1016/S0003-9993(96)90164-1,210,"OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS BURDEN OF CAREGIVERS TO STROKE PATIENTS THREE YEAR AFTER A PRIMARY STROKE AND TO TEST VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF A NOVEL CAREGIVER BURDEN SCALE (CB SCALE). DESIGN: A LONGITUDINAL COMMUNITY-BASED 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP STUDY OF 35 CONSECUTIVE PRIMARY STROKE PATIENTS INITIALLY ADMITTED TO AN ACUTE MEDICAL UNIT (MEAN AGE 82 YR). THE VALIDITY OF THE CB SCALE WAS STUDIED IN 150 PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 77 YR):83 DEMENTED OUTPATIENTS ASSESSED FOR NEED OF GROUP LIVING AND 67 OUTPATIENTS WITH STROKE FROM A GENERAL GERIATRIC DAY-CARE UNIT. RELIABILITY WAS STUDIED IN ANOTHER 23 OUTPATIENTS (MEAN AGE 72 YR) WITH STROKE FROM THE SAME UNIT. METHODS: A 22-ITEM CB SCALE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAREGIVER BURDEN AND SCALES FOR NEUROTICISM AND EXTROVERSION (EYSENCK PERSONALITY INVENTORY) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (II-ITEM SCALE). ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIFE WERE ASSESSED BY A 6-ITEM SCALE, INITIALLY AND 3 YEARS LATER. OUTCOME MEASURE: RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF THE CB SCALE. IMPROVEMENTS OF ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIFE OF STROKE PATIENTS. RESULTS: FACTOR ANALYSES OF THE CB SCALE GAVE FIVE INDICES-GENERAL STRAIN, ISOLATION, DISAPPOINTMENT, EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT, AND ENVIRONMENT-HAVING GOOD KAPPA VALUES, .89 TO 1.00 AND CRONBACH'S ALPHA, .70 TO .87, EXCEPT FOR ENVIRONMENT. A HIGHER BURDEN WAS RELATED TO A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP BUT NOT TO THE LIVING SITUATION. THE HIGHEST CAREGIVER BURDEN WAS FOUND AMONG PATIENTS SHOWING THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENTS OF ADL, WHEN DIVIDED INTO TERTILES. THE PATIENT'S DEGREE OF EXTROVERSION AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO CAREGIVER BURDEN, .46 (P < .05) AND .59 (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: THE CB SCALE PROVED TO BE A VALID AND RELIABLE INSTRUMENT TO ASSESS CAREGIVER BURDEN. TO IMPROVE THE CAREGIVER SITUATION, INDIVIDUAL PATIENT PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS, LIKE EXTROVERSION, FEELING OF QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE, MUST BE CONSIDERED.

3,CAREGIVER BURDEN AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG JAPANESE STROKE CAREGIVERS,MORIMOTO T;SCHREINER AS;ASANO H,10.1093/ageing/32.2.218,179,"OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY HAD TWO MAIN PURPOSES: 1. TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAREGIVER BURDEN AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF OLDER STROKE PATIENTS IN JAPAN; AND 2. TO EXAMINE WHICH CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CAREGIVING SITUATION SIGNIFICANTLY RELATE TO INCREASED BURDEN. METHODS: SUBJECTS (N = 100) WERE RECRUITED FROM SEVEN RANDOMLY SELECTED NEUROLOGICAL HOSPITALS WITH OUT-PATIENT REHABILITATION CLINICS IN WESTERN JAPAN AND INTERVIEWED USING THE ZARIT BURDEN INTERVIEW, THE MODIFIED BARTHEL INDEX, THE GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE AND THE SF-12 HEALTH SURVEY FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: INCREASED CAREGIVER BURDEN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO WORSENING HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PARTICULARLY WORSENING MENTAL HEALTH (GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE AND SF-12 ITEMS), EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR CAREGIVER AGE, SEX, CHRONIC ILLNESS, AVERAGE CAREGIVING HOURS/DAY, AND FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE OF THE CARE-RECIPIENT. DISCUSSION: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INCREASED BURDEN SIGNIFICANTLY RELATES TO DECREASED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG STROKE CAREGIVERS. IN ADDITION, THE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AMONG CAREGIVERS WAS TWICE THAT OF COMMUNITY DWELLING OLDER PEOPLE. ROUGHLY 52\% OF CAREGIVERS HAD GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE SCORES THAT WARRANTED FURTHER EVALUATION. DESPITE THE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS ONLY ONE CAREGIVER HAD RECEIVED ANY PSYCHIATRIC CARE DURING THEIR CAREGIVING TENURE."
4,BURDEN OF INFORMAL CAREGIVING FOR STROKE PATIENTS - IDENTIFICATION OF CAREGIVERS AT RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS,VAN EXEL NJA;KOOPMANSCHAP MA;VAN DEN BERG B;BROUWER WBF;VAN DEN BOS GAM,10.1159/000081906,112,"BACKGROUND: WE ASSESSED THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE BURDEN OF CAREGIVING FOR STROKE PATIENTS AND INVESTIGATED WHICH CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENT, THE INFORMAL CAREGIVER AND THE OBJECTIVE BURDEN CONTRIBUTE MOST TO SUBJECTIVE BURDEN AND TO THE CONDITION OF FEELING SUBSTANTIALLY BURDENED. METHODS: WE STUDIED A SAMPLE OF 151 STROKE SURVIVORS AND THEIR PRIMARY INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. WE COLLECTED DATA THROUGH PATIENT AND CAREGIVER INTERVIEWS 6 MONTHS AFTER STROKE. RESULTS: BOTH THE LEVEL OF SUBJECTIVE BURDEN AND THE CONDITION OF FEELING SUBSTANTIALLY BURDENED WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH CAREGIVER'S AND PATIENT'S HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PATIENT'S AGE, AND THE NUMBER OF CAREGIVING TASKS PERFORMED. CONCLUSIONS: THESE CONDITIONS CAN BE USED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE CAREGIVERS IN NEED OF SUPPORT AND AT RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. MONITORING STROKE SURVIVORS AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS AT DISCHARGE MAY HELP TO PREVENT OR ALLEVIATE CAREGIVER BURDEN. COPYRIGHT (C) 2005 S. KARGER AG, BASEL."
5,"CAREGIVER BURDEN, TIME SPENT CARING AND HEALTH STATUS IN THE FIRST 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING STROKE",TOOTH L;MCKENNA K;BARNETT A;PRESCOTT C;MURPHY S,10.1080/02699050500110785,98,"OBJECTIVE: TO QUANTIFY TIME CARING, BURDEN AND HEALTH STATUS IN CARERS OF STROKE PATIENTS AFTER DISCHARGE FROM REHABILITATION; TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OUTCOMES. METHODS: PATIENTS AND CARERS PROSPECTIVELY INTERVIEWED 6 (N = 71) AND 12 (N = 57) MONTHS AFTER DISCHARGE. RELATIONSHIPS OF CARER AND PATIENT VARIABLES WITH BURDEN, HEALTH STATUS AND TIME ANALYSED BY GAUSSIAN AND POISSON REGRESSION. RESULTS: CARERS SHOWED CONSIDERABLE BURDEN AT 6 AND 12 MONTHS. CARERS SPENT 4.6 AND 3.6 HOURS PER DAY ASSISTING PATIENTS WITH DAILY ACTIVITIES AT 6 AND 12 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. IMPROVED PATIENT MOTOR AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS OF UP TO 20 MINUTES PER DAY IN TIME SPENT IN DAILY ACTIVITIES. BETTER PATIENT MENTAL HEALTH AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER CARER MENTAL HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE FACTORS SUCH AS THESE MAY BE ABLE TO BE TARGETED BY CAREGIVER TRAINING, SUPPORT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMMES AND OUTPATIENT THERAPY FOR PATIENTS."
6,FACTORS AFFECTING THE BURDEN ON CAREGIVERS OF STROKE SURVIVORS IN SOUTH KOREA,CHOI-KWON S;KIM HS;KWON SU;KIM JS,10.1016/j.apmr.2004.09.013,92,"OBJECTIVE: TO ELUCIDATE THE FACTORS RELATED TO THE CAREGIVER BURDEN IN STROKE SURVIVORS IN SEOUL, KOREA. DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. SETTING: OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN KOREA. PARTICIPANTS: WE RANDOMLY SELECTED 340 STROKE PATIENTS AND EVALUATED THEM FOR 3 YEARS POSTSTROKE. AMONG THEM, 147 CAREGIVERS AND PATIENTS WERE FINALLY INTERVIEWED. INTERVENTIONS: PATIENTS' DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS, DEPRESSION, ERNOTIONAL INCONTINENCE, AND MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE (MRS) SCORE WERE ASSESSED. IN ADDITION, PRIMARY CAREGIVERS' DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, HOURS OF CARE PER DAY, RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PATIENTS, HEALTH STATUS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND THE PRESENCE OF ALTERNATIVE CAREGIVERS WERE ASSESSED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CAREGIVER BURDEN WAS EVALUATED WITH THE SENSE OF COMPETENCE QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH HAS 3 SUBDOMAINS WITH A TOTAL OF 27 ITEMS. RESULTS: CAREGIVER BURDEN SCORE WAS HIGH AS COMPARED WITH REPORTS FROM WESTERN SOCIETY. PATIENT FACTORS RELATED TO THE BURDEN SCORES WERE BEING UNEMPLOYED (P <.05), THE PRESENCE OF DIABETES MELLITUS (P < .05), APHASIA (P < .01), DYSARTHRIA (P < .05), DYSPHAGIA (P < .01), COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION (P < .01), SEVERE MRS SCORE (P < .01), EMOTIONAL INCONTINENCE (P < .05), AND DEPRESSION (P < .01). CAREGIVER FACTORS RELATED TO HIGH BURDEN SCORES WERE BEING FERNALE (P < .05), UNEMPLOYMENT (P < .01), BEING DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW (P < .01), ANXIETY (P < .01), DEPRESSION (P < .01), AND LONG CAREGIVING HOURS (P < .05). ON MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR FOR OVERALL CAREGIVER BURDEN WAS CAREGIVER ANXIETY FOLLOWED BY PATIENT MRS SCORE AND CAREGIVERS BEING DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW. CAREGIVER DEPRESSION, CURRENT EMPLOYMENT STATUS, AND PATIENT DEPRESSION WERE ALSO FACTORS RELATED TO THEIR BURDEN. CONCLUSIONS: CAREGIVER ANXIETY, PATIENT PHYSICAL DEFICITS, AND CAREGIVERS BEING DAUGHTER-IN-LAW ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS RELATED TO THE CAREGIVER BURDEN IN OUR POPULATION. STRATEGIES TO REDUCE CAREGIVER BURDEN SHOULD BE DEVELOPED BASED ON UNDERSTANDING OF THESE FACTORS.

7,ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH CAREGIVER BURDEN IN CAREGIVERS OF STROKE SURVIVORS WITH SPASTICITY,DENNO MS;GILLARD PJ;GRAHAM MD;GOREN A;VARON SF;ZOROWITZ R,10.1016/j.apmr.2013.03.014,86,"OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANXIETY/DEPRESSION AND CAREGIVER BURDEN IN INFORMAL CAREGIVERS OF STROKE SURVIVORS WITH SPASTICITY. DESIGN: DATA WERE COLLECTED VIA ONLINE SURVEYS FROM INFORMAL CAREGIVERS 18 YEARS OR OLDER WHO CARED FOR STROKE SURVIVORS. SETTING: INTERNET-BASED SURVEY. PARTICIPANTS: 2007 THROUGH 2009 U.S. NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS SURVEY DATABASE OR LIGHTSPEED RESEARCH GENERAL PANEL RESPONDENTS (N =153). INTERVENTIONS: NOT APPLICABLE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE SELF-REPORTED BY THE CAREGIVER AS A PHYSICIAN DIAGNOSIS. DEPRESSION SEVERITY WAS MEASURED BY THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-9 (PHQ-9). CAREGIVER BURDEN WAS MEASURED BY THE OBERST CAREGIVING BURDEN SCALE (OCBS) AND THE BAKAS CAREGIVING OUTCOMES SCALE (BCOS). LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED WITH ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND THE PHQ-9 DEPRESSION SEVERITY CATEGORIES AS A RESULT OF EACH CAREGIVER BURDEN SCALE. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED FOR 153 INFORMAL CAREGIVERS; THEY WERE MOSTLY WOMEN (70.6\%) AND WHITE (78.4\%), WITH A MEAN AGE OF 51.6 YEARS. FOR EVERY 1-POINT INCREASE IN THE OCBS DIFFICULTY SCALE, THE ODDS OF ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION WERE 2,57 TIMES AS GREAT (P<.001) AND 1.88 TIMES AS GREAT (P=.007), RESPECTIVELY. THE ODDS OF PHQ-9 SEVERE DEPRESSION VERSUS ALL OTHER CATEGORIES COMBINED WERE 2.48 TIMES AS GREAT (P<.001). FOR EVERY 1-POINT DECREASE IN THE BCOS, THE ODDS OF ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION WERE 2.43 TIMES AS GREAT (P<.001) AND 2.27 TIMES AS GREAT (P=.002), RESPECTIVELY. THE ODDS OF PHQ-9 SEVERE DEPRESSION VERSUS ALL OTHER CATEGORIES COMBINED WERE 4.55 TIMES AS GREAT (P<001). CONCLUSIONS: AS CAREGIVER BURDEN INCREASES, CAREGIVERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. DEPRESSION SEVERITY ALSO INCREASES. PROVIDING TREATMENT TO STROKE SURVIVORS WITH SPASTICITY THAT LESSENS THE TIME AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE DIFFICULTY OF CAREGIVING MAY LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN CAREGIVER ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.

8,"THE BALANCE OF GIVE AND TAKE IN CAREGIVER-PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS: AN EXAMINATION OF SELF-PERCEIVED BURDEN, RELATIONSHIP EQUITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CARE RECIPIENTS FOLLOWING STROKE",MCPHERSON CJ;WILSON KG;CHYURLIA C,10.1037/a0019359,77,"PURPOSE: WE EXAMINED THE SENSE OF BEING A BURDEN TO OTHERS OR SELF-PERCEIVED BURDEN (SPB) IN PEOPLE WITH STROKE. METHOD: A MAIL SURVEY WAS COMPLETED BY 57 FORMER INPATIENTS AND THEIR PARTNER CAREGIVERS. THE CARE RECIPIENT SURVEY INCLUDED MEASURES OF FUNCTIONAL STATUS, QUALITY OF LIFE, MARITAL SATISFACTION, EQUITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AS WELL AS SPB USING THE SELF-PERCEIVED BURDEN SCALE (SPBS; COUSINEAU, MCDOWELL, HOTZ, \& HEBERT, 2003). THE CAREGIVER SURVEY INCLUDED SIMILAR MEASURES IN ADDITION TO A CAREGIVER BURDEN MEASURE. RESULTS: SPB WAS FOUND TO BE A PREVALENT AND DISTRESSING CONCERN. SPBS SCORES CORRELATED WITH MEASURES OF FUNCTIONAL STATUS AND MOOD; HOWEVER, THE CORRELATIONS WERE HIGHEST FOR MEASURES OF FAMILY ROLES AND WORK/PRODUCTIVITY. USING EQUITY THEORY AS A BASIS TO EXAMINE THE SPB CONSTRUCT, CARE RECIPIENTS WHO PERCEIVED THEMSELVES AS OVERBENEFITING FROM THE RELATIONSHIP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SPB SCORES THAN THOSE WHOSE RELATIONSHIP WAS VIEWED AS EQUITABLE OR UNDERBENEFITING. CONCLUSIONS: FOR SOME RECEIVING CARE FROM A PARTNER AFTER STROKE IS ASSOCIATED SPB. THIS SENSE OF BURDEN IS RELATED TO CHANGES IN HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DISTRESS."
9,CAREGIVER BURDEN AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS IN PARTNERS OF STROKE PATIENTS AT TWO MONTHS AND ONE YEAR POST-STROKE: DETERMINANTS AND PREDICTION,KRUITHOF WJ;POST MWM;VAN MIERLO GAM;DE MAN-VAN GINKEL JMA,10.1016/j.pec.2016.04.007,72,"OBJECTIVES: (A) TO DETERMINE LEVELS OF AND FACTORS EXPLAINING PARTNERS' BURDEN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AT TWO MONTHS POST-STROKE, (B) TO PREDICT PARTNERS' BURDEN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AT ONE YEAR POST-STROKE BASED ON PATIENT AND PARTNER CHARACTERISTICS AVAILABLE AT TWO MONTHS POST-STROKE. METHODS: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. PARTNERS OF STROKE PATIENTS (N = 183) WERE INCLUDED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE THE CAREGIVER STRAIN INDEX AND THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE. RESULTS: MANY PARTNERS EXPERIENCED HIGH BURDEN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. AT TWO MONTHS POST-STROKE, THESE OUTCOMES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTNER VARIABLES: AGE, RELATIONSHIP SATISFACTION, PROACTIVE COPING, SELF-EFFICACY, EVERYDAY SOCIAL SUPPORT, BURDEN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; AND THE PATIENT VARIABLES: STROKE SEVERITY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. PARTNER OUTCOMES AT ONE YEAR POST-STROKE WERE MAINLY PREDICTED BY THE LEVEL OF THESE OUTCOMES AT TWO MONTHS POST-STROKE. CONCLUSIONS: PARTNER OUTCOMES AT TWO MONTHS POST-STROKE PREDICT TO A LARGE DEGREE PARTNER OUTCOMES AT ONE YEAR POST-STROKE. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: MEASURING PARTNERS' BURDEN AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN THE POST-ACUTE PHASE IS RECOMMENDED TO TRACE PARTNERS AT RISK OF LONG-TERM BURDEN AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.

10,ROLES OF CHANGING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND CAREGIVER BURDEN ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN STROKE: A LONGITUDINAL DYADIC ANALYSIS,PUCCIARELLI G;VELLONE E;SAVINI S;AUSILI D;ALVARO R;LEE CS;LYONS KS,10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.014989,71,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN STROKE SURVIVOR AND CAREGIVER QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES IN SURVIVOR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND CAREGIVER BURDEN (IE, THE IMPACT OF THE PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL DEMANDS OF CAREGIVING) INFLUENCE CHANGES IN QOL. METHODS LONGITUDINAL DESIGN WITH 226 STROKE SURVIVOR-CAREGIVER DYADS ENROLLED AT SURVIVOR DISCHARGE FROM REHABILITATION HOSPITALS. DATA COLLECTION WAS PERFORMED OVER 12 MONTHS. WE MEASURED SURVIVOR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, CAREGIVER BURDEN, AND QOL (PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL) IN BOTH SURVIVOR AND CAREGIVER. MULTILEVEL MODELING WAS USED TO CONTROL FOR THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE DATA. RESULTS SURVIVORS (50\% MALE SEX) AND CAREGIVERS (66\% FEMALE SEX) WERE 70.8 (SD=11.9) AND 52.4 (SD=13.1) YEARS OLD, RESPECTIVELY. OVER THE 12 MONTHS, STROKE SURVIVOR'S PHYSICAL (=1.59; P<0.001) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL (=0.86; P<0.05) QOL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED; SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL QOL DID NOT P>0.05. CAREGIVER QOL, ON AVERAGE, DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OVER TIME P>0.05. IMPROVEMENTS IN SURVIVOR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN SURVIVOR AND CAREGIVER PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL QOL AND SURVIVOR ENVIRONMENTAL QOL. DECREASES IN CAREGIVER BURDEN WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN CAREGIVER PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL QOL BUT NOT WITH SURVIVOR QOL. CONCLUSIONS QOL OF STROKE SURVIVORS AND CAREGIVERS COVARIES AND IS GREATLY IMPACTED BY THE PHYSICAL FUNCTION CHANGES OF THE SURVIVOR. DYADIC APPROACHES TO STROKE REHABILITATION THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF DYADS ARE NEEDED."
