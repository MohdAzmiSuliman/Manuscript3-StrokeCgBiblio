Abstract = {Background Although several authors have analyzed the effects of
   spirituality on stroke survivors' physical functioning and on their own
   caregiver's outcomes, such as quality of life, only few authors have
   explored the interaction between spirituality and anxiety and depression
   using a dyadic approach. Objectives The aim of this study was to analyze
   the influence of spirituality in the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad and
   specifically on anxiety and depression in both parties. Methods A total
   of 217 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads were enrolled at discharge from
   several rehabilitation hospitals in central and southern Italy. The
   actor-partner interdependence model was used to analyze the dyadic data.
   To verify the differences in the effects between survivors and
   caregivers, comparisons were made between the chi(2) values of the model
   in which actor and partner effects were constrained to be equal. Results
   The average age of stroke survivors and their caregivers at baseline was
   71.2 and 52.7 years, respectively. Among the stroke survivors, there
   were slightly more men than women, whereas 65\% of the caregivers were
   women. Most stroke survivors had had an ischemic stroke. Four
   statistically significant actor effects were identified. Higher
   survivors' and caregivers' spirituality was associated with higher
   survivor and caregiver anxiety. The only significant partner effect that
   was identified was the association between stroke survivor spirituality
   and caregiver depression. Conclusions This study highlights the
   importance of studying spirituality in the population with stroke.
   Spirituality seems to play an important protective role in both stroke
   survivors' and caregivers' depression but not in anxiety.},

   Stroke Caregivers: A Scoping Review of Access and Use},

Abstract = {Stroke can be a life altering event that necessitates considerable
   amounts of formal and informal care. The impacts of stroke often persist
   over time requiring ongoing support for stroke survivors. Family members
   provide the majority of care and experience many life changes as a
   result of their caregiving role including social, financial, employment
   and health impacts. Formal supports such as counselling, respite, and
   health promotion initiatives that directly benefit caregivers or benefit
   them indirectly through supporting the stroke survivor, are well-placed
   to help caregivers manage their caregiving role. However, to date little
   is known about formal service use by stroke caregivers and the factors
   that influence their service use. This scoping review provides a
   critique and synthesis of what is known about stroke caregivers' access
   and use of formal services intended to support them. Findings suggest
   that while services are available, caregivers' ability to use them are
   impacted by both facilitators and barriers. Facilitators included: sex,
   age, and having a higher household income (depending on services used).
   Barriers included: high cost, poor service quality and deficient
   knowledge/communication regarding service availability. This review
   highlights a significant gap in our knowledge of caregivers' experience
   in accessing and using formal services.},

Title = {Stroke-Specific Refinements to Naylor's Transitional Care Model to
   Address the Storm of Uncertainty and Unmet Survivor and Caregiver Needs},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: By 2030, there will be approximately 7.6 million stroke
   survivors (SSs) in the United States, yet comprehensive transitional
   care (TC) for stroke is not widely available. Stroke strikes without
   warning and leaves in its wake a ``storm{''} of uncertainty for SSs and
   caregivers (CGs) as they encounter a myriad of unmet physical, mental,
   emotional, and financial needs that are not wholly addressed by passive
   healthcare delivery systems. Needed is a stroke-specific TC model that
   bridges this storm to active delivery of SS and CG postacute care.
   Naylor's Transitional Care Model (NTCM) has not been examined for how it
   can frame comprehensive stroke care. The purpose of this study was to
   solicit SS and CG descriptions of TC experiences to inform the NTCM with
   refined operational definitions and exemplars specific to stroke.
   METHODS: Focus groups conducted for this qualitative descriptive study
   were guided by interview questions based on the 8 NTCM operational
   definitions. Data were analyzed using inductive and deductive
   qualitative content analysis methods. RESULTS: Post-acute-stroke care
   does not comprehensively meet the needs of SSs and CGs. Participants
   described TC deficits across all 8 NTCM components. Two new
   subcomponents that could be applied for a stroke-specific NTCM emerged:
   psychological and transportation challenges. CONCLUSION: Unmet needs
   identified by SSs and CGs were used to extend NTCM specific to the
   stroke population and to develop the Recommendations and Exemplars for
   Stroke Specific Comprehensive Transitional Care Delivery (see
   Supplementary Digital Content, available at
   http://linksiww.com/JNN/A385) . Researchers and practitioners can use
   the findings to develop and deliver more comprehensive TC to SSs and
   CGs.},

Title = {Stroke Rehabilitation Use and Caregiver Psychosocial Health Profiles in
   Singapore: A Latent Profile Transition Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION},

Abstract = {Objectives: To identify and describe caregiver profiles based on their
   psychosocial health characteristics over a 12-month period and
   transitions among these profiles, to determine if stroke rehabilitation
   use at 12 months post-stroke differed by caregiver profile transition
   patterns, and to investigate if caregiver profiles at 3 months
   post-stroke moderate the association of stroke rehabilitation use at 3
   months and 12 months post-stroke after accounting for covariates.
   Design: Latent profile transition analysis of caregiver psychosocial
   health with stroke rehabilitation use at 12 month post-stroke as
   outcome. Setting and Participants: A total of 149 stroke
   patient-caregiver dyads from the Singapore Stroke Study. Methods:
   Cross-sectional latent profile analyses were conducted on caregiver
   psychosocial health indicators of burden, depression, health status,
   quality of relationship with patient, and social support. Changes in
   latent profile classification over 3 time points (baseline, 3 months,
   and 12 months post stroke) were analyzed using latent transition
   analysis. A transition model with stroke rehabilitation use at 12 months
   post-stroke as the outcome was tested after accounting for covariates.
   Results: Two distinct caregiver psychosocial health latent profiles were
   found across time: nondistressed and distressed. Most caregivers were
   classified as nondistressed and remained nondistressed over time.
   Distressed caregivers at baseline were 76\% likely to become
   nondistressed at 12 month post-stroke. Regardless of profile transition
   patterns, nondistressed caregivers at 12 months post-stroke tended to
   have cared for stroke rehabilitation nonusers at 12 months post-stroke.
   Patient depression explained profile classification at 3 months and 12
   months post-stroke. After accounting for covariates, rehabilitation
   users at 3 months post-stroke tended to continue using rehabilitation at
   12 months post-stroke only when they had nondistressed caregivers at 3
   months post-stroke. Conclusions and Implications: Whether caregiver
   adaptation explains the associations between the latent profile
   transition patterns and rehabilitation use at 12 months post-stroke
   should be examined. Early psychosocial health assessment and sustained
   support should be made available to stroke caregivers to enhance their
   well-being and subsequent patient rehabilitation participation. (c) 2021

Abstract = {Purpose To assess the available evidence regarding the quality of life
   (QoL) of informal caregivers of stroke survivors, by identifying the
   instruments used to assess QoL, and its associated characteristics.
   Methods A scoping review was performed, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines.
   The electronic databases PubMed, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, and
   SciELO were searched for empirical, peer-reviewed, original, and
   full-length studies on the characteristics influencing the QoL of
   informal caregivers of stroke survivors. Eligibility and data extraction
   were conducted by two independent researchers. The main quantitative
   findings were synthesized, and qualitative data were explored by
   thematic content analysis. Results The included studies, 56
   quantitative, 1 qualitative, and 1 mixed methods, were published between
   1999 and 2020. A high heterogeneity was found regarding the assessment
   of QoL, and the characteristics influencing it. Only one study used an
   instrument specifically designed to assess the stroke caregivers' QoL.
   The QoL of informal caregivers was inversely associated with physical
   and mental health of stroke survivors and caregivers, while stroke
   characteristics with a better prognosis, caregivers' positive
   relationships, and a more supportive and participative social context
   were positively associated to QoL. Conclusion There is a need for
   standardizing the assessment of the QoL of informal caregivers of stroke
   survivors, as well as for investing in cross-country/cultural studies
   with robust mixed methods designs to allow a deeper understanding of the
   experiences of caregivers. Further research, policies, and practices
   should consider the diversity and complexity of the characteristics
   influencing QoL, to empower informal caregivers and improve their QoL.},

Abstract = {Objective The objective of this review was to elucidate the evidence
   related to utilizing e-Health as a tool in improving the quality of life
   of informal caregivers of dependent patients due to cerebrovascular
   accident (CVA). Methods This systematic review with meta-analysis
   includes 13 studies. For these studies, seven databases were searched
   between 2009 and 2019. A random-effects model was adopted for overall
   estimation and to explain the heterogeneity. Results A random-effects
   model was adopted for overall estimation and to explain heterogeneity.
   The results did not demonstrate statistical significance (p<0.05) and
   low heterogeneity (I-2 = 0). Conclusions There is a tendency toward
   improvement in psychological health, solving care-related problems, as
   well as better prevention of problems arising from the burden.
   Therefore, new studies with larger sample size and primarily to conduct
   them for more than 6 months for the accuracy. Clinical relevance This
   study reflects a trend toward improving psychological health, solving
   care-related problems, as well as improved the prevention of problems
   arising from the burden.},

Title = {An Exploratory Qualitative Study With Older Malaysian Stroke Survivors,
   Caregivers, and Healthcare Practitioners About Falls and Rehabilitation
   for Falls After Stroke},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Studies on rehabilitation for falls after a stroke remain
   limited despite its impact being profound. This scenario justifies a
   deeper understanding of why falls in stroke rehabilitation received less
   attention. Current investigations on the perception of falls and stroke
   also proved inadequate. Therefore, this study aims to explore the
   perceptions and experiences of older Malaysian stroke survivors, spousal
   caregivers, and healthcare practitioners on falls in stroke
   rehabilitation.
   Method: A qualitative study of three focus groups with 18 individuals
   from one community-based stroke rehabilitation center was conducted. The
   discussions were audio-recorded, video-recorded, transcribed,
   summarized, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis: (i) perceived factors
   and consequences of falls after stroke, (ii) physical-based
   interventions predominate in rehabilitation for falls after stroke, and
   (iii) the role of home hazards in fall prevention is taken for granted.
   Although, awareness of falls is high, they are regarded as a peripheral
   issue in stroke. Rehabilitation interventions such as improved
   functionality are believed to be adequate and can indirectly prevent
   falls. Other interventions for fall prevention such as home hazards
   management are relatively less known.
   Conclusion: There is a need for more attention regarding home
   environment risk assessment and intervention among healthcare
   professionals, and more education for clients and caregivers is
   required. Although, other stroke interventions may also benefit stroke
   survivors, falls prevention should be a central component in stroke
   rehabilitation. As this study focused on a specific population, the
   findings should be validated with larger populations, and in diverse
   settings.},

Abstract = {Background Stroke can impose a heavy burden on caregivers. Caring for
   stroke patients at home is more challenging than in hospitals with
   facilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a
   supportive home care program on caregiver burden with stroke patients.
   Methods This was an experimental study. One hundred sixteen caregivers
   of stroke patients were recruited using convenience sampling from two
   university-affiliated hospitals in Tehran from June 2019 to February
   2020. They were randomly allocated into two groups (supportive home care
   program and routine hospital education program) using a randomized block
   design. The supportive home care program included eight educational
   sessions delivered in the hospital before discharge, and with home
   visits after hospital discharge. Caregiver burden was measured using
   Caregiver Burden Inventory. The data were analyzed using independent
   samples t-test and Analysis of Covariance. Results Caregiver burden in
   the routine education group increased significantly after 2 weeks, from
   52.27 +/- 23.95 to 62.63 +/- 22.68. The mean of caregiver burden scores
   in the supportive home care program decreased from 44.75 +/- 17.21 to
   40.46 +/- 17.28. The difference between the scores of the two groups
   before the intervention was not significantly different (t = 1.941, df =
   114, p = 0.055). There was a significant difference between the two
   groups regarding caregiver burden scores after the intervention period
   (eta(2) = 0.305, P < 0.001). Conclusions Caregiver burden increased
   significantly after the discharge without proper interventions in the
   caregivers of stroke patients. Providing support for home care providers
   can help to decrease or prevent the intensification of caregiver burden.},

Title = {Types of stroke-related deficits and their impact on family caregiver's
   depressive symptoms, burden, and quality of life},
Journal = {DISABILITY AND HEALTH JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke caregiving has been associated with higher rates of
   caregiver burden, depression, and lower quality of life compared to
   non-caregivers. Little is known about relationships between stroke
   survivors' Cognitive/Emotional and Motor/Functional deficits and
   caregivers' outcomes.
   Objective: To determine the relationship between stroke survivors'
   Cognitive/Emotional deficits and Motor/Functional deficits and
   caregivers' depression, burden, and quality of life.
   Method: This is a retrospective secondary data analysis. The sample
   consisted of 109 caregivers of stroke survivors. Step-wise linear
   multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine if Cognitive/
   Emotional deficits and/or Motor/Functional deficits, were predictive of
   caregivers' depressive symptoms, burden, physical quality of life, and
   mental quality of life.
   Results: The Cognitive/Emotional deficits category was a better
   predictor than the Motor/Functional deficit of caregivers' depressive
   symptoms, burden, and mental quality of life. The Cognitive/Emotional
   deficit score positively predicted both depression (b = .49, p < .001)
   and burden (b = 0.39, p < .001) and negatively predicted mental quality
   of life (b =-0.42, p < .001), though it did not significantly predict
   physical quality of life (b =-0.01, p = .90). The motor/functional
   deficits failed to significantly predict any of the caregiver outcomes
   (all p-values >.05).
   Conclusions: The Cognitive/Emotional deficits appear to impact caregiver
   well-being more than the Motor/Functional deficits. Understanding the
   impact of Cognitive/Emotional and Motor/Functional def-icits on
   caregivers can help clinicians identify caregivers at the highest risk
   for negative outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy in Sleep Disorder and Depressive
   Symptoms Among Chinese Caregivers of Stroke Inpatients: A Structural
   Equation Modeling Analysis},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {3635-3643},
Abstract = {Purpose: Caregivers of stroke inpatients are at high risk of sleep
   disorder, which may lead to depressive symptoms. Self-efficacy has
   always been regarded as a protective factor against psychological
   disorders such as depressive symptoms. This study aims to investigate
   the sleep disorder and depressive symptoms of caregivers of stroke
   inpatients in China and explore the mediating effect of self-efficacy
   between sleep disorder and depressive symptoms among Chinese caregivers
   of stroke inpatients. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional
   study, a total of 305 caregivers who were hospitalized with stroke
   patients completed the PROMIS Sleep Disorder Short Form Scale, General
   Self-Efficacy Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in two general
   public hospitals in northeast and southeast China. A structural equation
   model with bootstrap method was performed to determine the mediation of
   self-efficacy between sleep disorder and depressive symptoms. Results:
   Among the participants, 55.4\% of caregivers reported depressive
   symptoms. Sleep disorder and self-efficacy were significant predictors
   of depressive symptoms. The direct impact of sleep disorder on
   depressive symptoms was positive, and the path coefficient of sleep
   disorder with depressive symptoms was decreased from 0.45 to 0.38 (P <
   0.01) after addition of self-efficacy in the model. This indicated that
   self-efficacy played as mediator. Conclusion: The caregivers of stroke
   inpatients were in poor physical and psychological health, and more than
   half of the caregivers (55.4\%) suffered from depressive symptoms. Our
   research revealed the mediation of self-efficacy between sleep disorder
   and depressive symptoms, and emphasized the importance of enhancing
   self-efficacy to reduce depressive symptoms among caregivers of stroke
   inpatients. These results demonstrate that focusing on self-efficacy
   interventions can enhance mental health and reduce depressive symptoms
   effectively.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: For family caregivers, sudden stroke events and heavy caring
   works are stressful events. At present, controversies about the factors
   affecting caregivers' stress response and their correlation with coping
   styles still exist.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore the influencing factors and coping styles of
   mental health stress responses of stroke caregivers and promote
   caregivers to adopt positive coping styles for diseases and caring
   works.
   METHODS: The convenience sampling method is used to select stroke
   caregivers as the research objects. The general information
   questionnaires, Relative Stress Scale (RSS), General Self-Efficacy Scale
   (GSES), Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), Positive and Negative Affect
   Schedule (PANAS), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) are
   utilized for investigation.
   RESULTS: 205 valid questionnaires are returned. Analysis suggests that
   the influential factors of mental health stress responses of stroke
   caregivers include the course of the disease, the impact of the disease
   on economic conditions, obligation to take care of other family members,
   understanding of stroke-associated diseases, and whether the patient is
   at risk. Social support and self-efficacy are negatively correlated with
   stress responses, while negative coping style is significantly
   positively correlated with stress responses.
   CONCLUSIONS: By increasing social support and self-efficacy, medical
   workers can guide stroke caregivers to take positive coping styles,
   thereby reducing their mental health stress responses.},

Title = {Postdischarge Intervention for Stroke Caregivers: Protocol for a
   Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: The majority of stroke survivors return to their homes and
   need assistance from family caregivers to perform activities of daily
   living. These increased demands coupled with the lack of preparedness
   for their new roles lead to a high risk for caregivers developing
   depressive symptoms and other negative outcomes. Follow-up home support
   and problem-solving interventions with caregivers are crucial for
   maintaining stroke survivors in their homes. Problem-solving
   interventions are effective but are underused in practice because they
   require large amounts of staff time to implement and are difficult for
   caregivers logistically.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to test a problem-solving
   intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered over the
   telephone during the patient's transitional care period (time when the
   stroke survivor is discharged to home) followed by 8 asynchronous online
   sessions.
   Methods: The design is a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial with
   repeated measures. We will enroll 240 caregivers from eight Veterans
   Affairs (VA) medical centers. Participants randomized into the
   intervention arm receive a modified problem-solving intervention that
   uses telephone and web-based support and training with interactive
   modules, fact sheets, and tools on the previously developed and
   nationally available Resources and Education for Stroke Caregivers'
   Understanding and Empowerment Caregiver website. In the usual care
   group, no changes are made in the information, discharge planning, or
   care the patients who have had a stroke normally receive, and caregivers
   have access to existing VA resources (eg, caregiver support line,
   self-help materials). The primary outcome is a change in caregiver
   depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection.
   Secondary outcomes include changes in stroke caregivers' burden,
   knowledge, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, perceived
   stress, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with care and
   changes in stroke survivors' functional abilities and health care use.
   The team will also determine the budgetary impact, facilitators,
   barriers, and best practices for implementing the intervention.
   Throughout all phases of the study, we will collaborate with members of
   an advisory panel.
   Results: Study enrollment began in June 2015 and is ongoing. The first
   results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021.
   Conclusions: This is the first known study to test a transitional care
   and messaging center intervention combined with technology to decrease
   caregiver depressive symptoms and to improve the recovery of stroke
   survivors. If successful, findings will support an evidence-based model
   that can be transported into clinical practice to improve the quality of
   caregiving post stroke.},

Title = {Effect of Informational Support on Anxiety in Family Caregivers of
   Patients with Hemiplegic Stroke},

Abstract = {Background: Brain stroke causes physical and mental disabilities, as
   well as dependence on one's family. In such cases, the families suffer
   from severe crisis and anxiety due to the unexpected incidence of the
   disease and unawareness of the associated consequences. Objectives: The
   aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
   informational support on the level of anxiety in family caregivers of
   hemiplegic stroke patients. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was
   performed on 78 family caregivers of hemiplegic stroke patients admitted
   to the Neurology Department of Farshchian Hospital in Hamadan, Iran,
   over 8 months. The subjects were selected through convenience sampling
   method and divided into two groups of intervention (n = 40) and control
   (n = 38). Intervention started from the third day of hospitalization and
   continued until the eleventh day. During this period, information about
   the ward, equipment, patient status, and care procedure at home, was
   provided for the intervention group individually and in groups. On the
   other hand, the control group only received the routine care. Anxiety
   level of caregivers was measured through the Spielberger scale both
   before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed in SPSS
   software (version 16). Results: Based on the results, both groups were
   similar in terms of demographic variables (P > 0.05). Moreover, there
   was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean
   level of state and trait anxiety before the intervention (P > 0.05).
   However, after intervention, the mean level of state and trait anxiety
   of the intervention group showed a significant reduction in comparison
   to that of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: According to the
   findings, it can be concluded that informational support is effective in
   reducing the state and trait anxiety in family caregivers of stroke
   patients. Therefore, it is suggested that nurses consider informational
   support as an important nursing intervention during hospitalization.},

   (CEDArS): feasibility randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPIST},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Abstract = {Demands placed on informal caregivers can result in an increased
   likelihood of experiencing common mental health difficulties that may
   affect their ability to undertake the caring role. Currently, however,
   few evidence-based interventions have been specifically developed for
   informal caregivers and available interventions are difficult to access.
   The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme aims to
   improve access to evidence-based psychological therapies for all groups
   and may therefore present an opportunity to meet informal caregiver
   needs. Located within the MRC Complex Intervention Framework, a Phase II
   feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) examines key
   methodological, procedural and clinical uncertainties associated with
   running a definitive Phase III RCT of an adapted written cognitive
   behavioural therapy (CBT) self-help intervention for informal caregivers
   of stroke survivors. Recruitment was low despite different recruitment
   strategies being adopted, highlighting significant challenges moving
   towards a Phase III RCT until resolved. Difficulties with study
   recruitment may reflect wider challenges engaging informal caregivers in
   psychological interventions and may have implications for IAPT services
   seeking to improve access for this group. Further attempts to develop a
   successful recruitment protocol to progress to a Phase III RCT examining
   effectiveness of the adapted CBT self-help intervention should be
   encouraged.},

Abstract = {Complex public health programmes may suffer from `teething problems'
   during their implementation in practice, especially when programmes are
   developed top-down without the participation of end-users and service
   providers. Trying out and optimising a new concept in practice with
   stakeholder ` s participation may enhance the programme ` s chance of
   success. In this article we describe the participatory optimisation
   process of a German primary prevention programme for stroke caregivers,
   performed before its full-scale implementation. A Participatory Action
   Research (PAR) approach was applied immediately after the development of
   the preliminary programme that was led by the professional research
   team. Iterative PAR-cycles were composed of: observe, reflect, plan and
   act. Through PAR a matured concept, containing eight Conceptual Building
   Blocks, was obtained. The five preliminary building blocks: `Content `,
   `Human resources `, `Personalised approach `, `Timing `, and `Setting `,
   were prioritised to be the core blocks, providing the base for
   individual caregiver support. Three new building blocks: `Network
   building `, `Communication `, and `Social safety-net ` were designated
   as facilitating blocks, interconnecting and safeguarding the programme.
   PAR was found to be vital in systematically detecting the conceptual
   weaknesses of the preliminary concept and in adjusting its components to
   the needs of the key stakeholders, before full-scale implementation.},

Abstract = {Content produced by caregivers of stroke survivors on the online
   video-sharing platform YouTube may be a good source of knowledge
   regarding caregivers' unmet needs. We aimed to examine the content,
   quantity and quality of YouTube videos that target and discuss the needs
   and concerns of caregivers of stroke survivors. YouTube was
   systematically searched using six search strings, and the first 20
   videos retrieved from each search were screened against the inclusion
   criteria. A pre-determined coding schedule was used to report the rate
   of unmet needs in each video. Twenty-six videos were included in the
   analysis. In total, 291 unmet needs were reported by caregivers of
   stroke survivors, an average of 11.2 unmet needs per video. The most
   common unmet needs domain was `Impact of Caregiving on Daily Activities'
   (44\%). Most videos were developed in the United States (61.5\%) and
   featured spouses of stroke survivors (65.47\%). Content produced by
   caregivers of stroke survivors on YouTube may be used as a tool for
   caregivers to provide and receive support through online communication.
   YouTube videos offer insight into the unmet needs of caregivers of
   stroke survivors and may be used as an additional resource for stroke
   services to support caregivers.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   Burden of Care and Quality of Life in informal home caregivers of stroke
   patients in Iran. Also we were trying to explore the factors that affect
   the burden of care. In this cross-sectional study, we have selected 62
   informal home caregivers of the patients admitted to ``the stroke
   outpatient unit of the neurology clinic{''} of the central hospital in
   Semnan province, Iran, to take part in the investigation. We interviewed
   them using the Caregiver Burden Inventory and SF-36 Questionnaire for
   assessing their quality of life. There was a negative and significant
   correlation between different aspects of quality of life and burden of
   care. In the bivariate regression model, being married and having lower
   levels of education (minimum years of schooling) were associated with
   higher levels of the burden. Our study shows that increasing burden of
   care in informal home caregivers reduces the quality of life in all
   domains. Thus, the results of this study indicate that an increase in
   the burden of caregiving on caregivers lowers their quality of life in
   all aspects; especially, caregivers who provide care to their spouses
   encountered more burden. Therefore, these caregivers must be in the
   center of interest while planning to reduce the burden of care.},

Title = {Correlates of social support on report of probable common mental
   disorders in Zimbabwean informal caregivers of patients with stroke: a
   cross-sectional survey},
Journal = {BMC RESEARCH NOTES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Objective Stroke is a major global public health burden. Unfortunately,
   stroke invariably leads to functional limitations, consequently, most
   stroke survivors are hugely dependent on family members/informal
   caregivers in carrying out essential daily activities. The increased
   demands of caregiving negatively impact caregivers' mental health.
   Nevertheless, caregivers who receive an adequate amount of social
   support are likely to adjust better to the caregiving role. We sought to
   determine the impact of social support on the mental wellbeing of 71
   caregivers of patients with stroke in Zimbabwe, a low-resourced country.
   Results The mean caregiver age was 41.5 (SD 13.8) years. Patients had a
   mean age of 65.2 (SD 15.3) years with most being functionally dependent
   (93.2\%). 45.1\% of the caregivers showed excessive psychiatric
   morbidity. The mean Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support
   (MSPSS) score was 44 (SD 9.4), denoting high levels of social support.
   Caregivers who received an adequate amount of social support were likely
   to report of lower psychiatric morbidity (Rho = - 0.285, p = 0.016).
   Furthermore, caregiver who were; poorer, were caring for more
   functionally-dependent patients, and did not receive additional
   assistance were likely to report of poor mental health functioning.
   There is therefore a strong need to implement context-specific
   caregivers wellness programs.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: Women minorities have an overall increased
   lifetime incidence of cerebrovascular disease. The provision of risk
   factor modification in this group can prove difficult. In a population
   based study. we used cluster enrollment to identify vascular risk
   factors in the female caregivers of stroke survivor study participants.
   Methods: Obese women caregivers were identified as part of Swipe out
   Stroke, a Phase I PROBE study assessing the use of SmartPhone based
   intervention for dietary modification minority stroke survivors. After
   written informed consent was obtained. both parents and caregivers were
   screened for vascular risk factors at study enrollment. Descriptive
   statistics were used to depict the study population. Continuous baseline
   variables were compared using 2 sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test
   by caregivers and patients. Categorical baseline variables were compared
   using Fisher's exact test.
   Results: Thirty-six stroke patients (63.9\% African-American, 36.1\%
   Hispanic) and thirteen female caregivers (69.2\% African-American.
   30.8\% Hispanic) were enrolled. Mean age, patients - 54.1 (SD 9.4),
   caregivers - 51.3 (SD 15.6) years, education, employment status and
   family history of stroke or obesity did not differ significantly.
   Compared to stroke patients, female caregivers were significantly less
   likely to self-report hypertension (69.2 versus 97.2\%: P = 0.01) and
   hyperlipidemia (16.7 versus 60\%: P = 0.02).
   Female caregivers were more likely to have elevated systolic blood
   pressure (147.6 vs 127.7 mmHg; P=0.05), total cholesterol (207.5 versus
   167 mg/dL; P = 0.01) and low density lipoprotein values (119.5 versus 88
   mg/dL P = 0.03) compared to stroke patients.
   Conclusions: Using cluster enrollment, we discovered minority female
   caregivers were more likely to have unknown or poorly controlled
   vascular risk factors compared to stroke patients. Innovative health
   screening tools may benefit the extended family of minority patients
   participating in clinical trials.},

Abstract = {Objectives Stroke survivors require assistance and support in their
   daily lives. This survey aims to investigate the needs and rights
   awareness in Chinese stroke survivors and caregivers in rural and urban
   settings.
   Setting This survey was adapted from the one created by the World Stroke
   Organization. The questionnaire included demands for psychological
   support, treatment and care, social support and information. From
   January 2015 to January 2016, the survey was pilot tested with urban and
   rural-dwelling stroke survivors and caregivers from 12 hospitals. Stroke
   survivors were invited to participate if they were over 18 years old and
   had experienced a stroke. Exclusion criteria were patients who had
   disorders of consciousness, significant cognitive impairment, aphasia,
   communication difficulties or psychiatric disorders. Only caregivers who
   were family members of the patients were chosen. Paid caregivers were
   excluded.
   Participants One thousand, one hundred and sixty-seven stroke survivors
   and 1119 caregivers were enrolled.
   Primary outcome measures The needs of stroke survivors and caregivers in
   rural and urban areas were compared. The correlations between needs of
   rural and urban stroke survivors and caregivers and potential effect
   factors were analysed, respectively.
   Results Among the cohort, 93.5\% reported the need for psychological
   support, 88.6\% for treatment and care, 84.8\% for information and
   62.7\% for social support. The total needs and each aspect of needs of
   stroke survivors in urban settings were greater than of those in rural
   settings (p< 0.01). In rural areas, total needs and each aspect of needs
   were positively correlated with education level (p< 0.01).
   Conclusions Needs and rights awareness of stroke survivors should also
   be recognised in both urban and rural China. According to the different
   needs of patients and their caregivers, regional and individualised
   services were needed by stroke survivors and their caregivers.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Caring fora person suffering from a chronic illness
   creates a lot of stress for the caregiver and family of the patient.
   Self-efficacy is a tool to improve health and training to the caregiver;
   promoting self-efficacy is a significant procedure in patient care and
   behavioral modification. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   effectiveness of follow-up calls by nurses on the self-efficacy of
   stroke patients'caregivers.
   Methodology: In this research, a clinical trial study was carried out
   using pre-test and post-test with the participation of 70 stroke
   patients' caregivers. They have selected through simple sampling and
   were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. Demographic
   information questionnaire and Sherer general self-efficacy scale were
   selected as tools for collecting data. Data were analyzed through
   independent t-test, paired t-test and Chi-Square using SPSS software
   version 21.
   Results: In the present study, the mean age of caregivers was 36.48 +/-
   10.44, and the majority of caregivers were patients' children. There was
   no significant difference in mean score of self-efficacy between the two
   groups before the intervention (P >= 0.05), but after the intervention,
   a significant difference (P <=.05) was observed following an increase in
   the mean score of self-efficacy in the intervention group. The
   comparison of self-efficacy score in the intervention group before and
   after the study demonstrated that the mean score of self-efficacy
   increased to 63.87 +/- 8.79 before the intervention and 68.43 +/- 7.17
   after the intervention. This increase was statistically significant (P =
   .001).
   Conclusion: According to the results of the current study, it can be
   concluded that the nurse's follow-up phone call program resulted in the

Title = {The Effect of Educational Intervention on Family Caregivers' Perceived
   Threat of the Risk of Dependence Among Patients with Stroke: A
   Randomized Clinical Trial},
Journal = {IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is the main cause of adult inability and dependency
   on caregiver in performing activities of daily living (ADLs). Studies
   showed that the caregivers of such patients experienced high levels of
   dependency-induced caring pressure and, consequently,
   physical-psychological problems.
   Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the effect of the
   instructional intervention on family caregivers' perceived threat of
   stroke patients dependency risk.
   Methods: In a randomized controlled clinical trial study, a total of 45
   pairs of stroke patients and their family caregivers were selected based
   on inclusion and exclusion criteria and randomly divided into the
   intervention and control groups. Sampling lasted from July 2016 to March
   2017 and was performed in Tehran, Iran. Instructional intervention for
   family caregivers in the intervention group was in the form of four
   one-hour sessions. The data were collected before and immediately after
   instructional intervention at the hospital as well as two weeks and two
   months following the intervention via postal service.
   Results: The mean rank of family caregivers' perceived threat was 1.44
   and 2.76 in pre-intervention stage of intervention and control groups,
   which became 2.49 and 2.49 two months after intervention, respectively.
   The Friedman test showed that there was a significant difference in all
   post instructional intervention stages compared with pre-intervention (P
   < 0.001), whereas no such difference was observed in the control group
   (P = 0.245). The Mann-Whitney U test also showed that the
   pre-intervention family caregivers perceived threat was also not
   significantly different in the two groups (P = 0.591). However, it was
   increased immediately, two weeks, and two months following the
   intervention compared with the control group (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: It is recommended that stroke patients' caregivers be
   provided with instructional programs to enhance their understanding of
   patient dependency risks and challenges.},

Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effect of caregiver driven robot-assisted
   in-ward training in subacute stroke patients.
   Methods A retrospective evaluation was performed for patients treated
   with caregiver driven robot-assisted inward training to retain gait
   function from June 2014 and December 2016. All patients received more
   than 2 weeks of caregiver driven robot-assisted in-ward training after
   undergoing conventional programs. The robot was used as a sitting
   device, a standing frame, or a high-walker depending on functional
   status of the patient. Patients were evaluated before and after robot
   training. Patient records were assessed by Korean version of Modified
   Barthel Index (K-MBI), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and
   Functional Ambulation Category (FAC).
   Results Initially, patients used the robot as a sitting device (n=6), a
   standing frame (n=7), or a partial body-weight support high-walker
   (n=2). As patient functions were improved, usage level of the robot was
   changed to the next level. At the end of the treatment, the robot was
   used as a sitting device (n=1), a standing frame (n=6), or high-walker
   (n=8). Scores of K-MBI (Delta 17.47 +/- 10.72) and FIM (Delta 19.80 +/-
   12.34) were improved in all patients.
   Conclusion Patients' usage level of the robot and functional scores were
   improved. Therefore, performing additional caregiver driven
   robot-assisted in-ward training is feasible and beneficial for subacute
   stroke patients.},

Title = {To be or not to be? A caregiver's question: the lived experience of a
   stroke family during the first 18 months poststroke},

Abstract = {BackgroundDisability following a stroke often requires family, commonly
   a spouse, to provide care enabling the stroke survivor to return home.
   Immediate or extended family and friends may help provide direct care or
   support the primary caregiver. While family members share the common
   stroke experience, this is lived within the context of separate lives.
   Research examining the individual nuances, roles and contribution of
   family and/or friends forming part of collective stroke networks, has
   largely been overlooked.
   AimThis New Zealand study aimed to explore the lived experience of three
   stroke family members during the 18 months following a first-ever
   stroke.
   MethodHermeneutic phenomenology guided the study. Informed consent was
   obtained prior to individual interviews conducted 6 weeks, 12 months and
   18 months poststroke.
   FindingsThree main themes emerged: (i) Being prepared, (ii) Where you
   stand changes the view and (iii) Relinquishing and reclaiming. Being
   prepared revealed how these family members anticipated the stroke and
   drew on personal and professional experience in facing the phenomenon.
   The second theme showed the influence of expectation and positionality
   on family members' experiences. Relinquishing and reclaiming identified
   loss, grief and a quest for equity in the synthesis of competing stroke
   survivor and caregiver desires.
   ConclusionsFamiliarity with the caregiving role and experience of
   unreliable community services led stroke family members to question the
   primary caregiver's ability to resume caregiving following a family
   member's stroke. The primary caregiver was physically and emotionally
   spent, and rest home care for the survivor became the only
   self-preserving option. A new caring arrangement was formulated seeking
   equity for both stroke survivor and caregiver.},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the relationship between caregiver nature and
   availability, and rehabilitation outcomes in subacute stroke.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: Four community rehabilitation hospitals.
   Participants: Patients with subacute, first-time stroke (N=4042; 48.5\%
   men; mean age +/- SD, 70.12 +/- 10.4y; 51.5\% women; mean age W +/- SD,
   72.54 +/- 10.0y).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Rehabilitation effectiveness, defined as the
   percentage of potential improvement eventually achieved with
   rehabilitation; and rehabilitation efficiency, defined as the rate of
   functional improvement during rehabilitation.
   Results: In our cohort, 96.7\% had available caregiver(s), of which
   42.0\% were primarily supported by foreign domestic workers (FDW5),
   25.9\% by spouses, 19.3\% by first-degree relatives, 7.8\% by other
   relatives, and 5.1\% by other caregivers. Using quantile regression, we
   found that having `a caregiver was independently associated with
   rehabilitation efficiency ({[}beta=-3.83; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 6.99 to 0.66; P=.018). The relationship between caregiver
   availability and rehabilitation effectiveness was modified by patient
   sex in that the negative association was significantly greater in men
   ((beta=-22.81; 95\% CI, -32.70 to -12.94; P<.001) than women (beta=
   5.64; 95\% CI, 14.72 to 3.44; P=.223). Having a FDW as a caregiver
   compared with a spousal caregiver was negatively associated with
   rehabilitation effectiveness ((3=-3.95; 95\% CI, 6.94 to 0.95; P=.01)
   and rehabilitation efficiency ((3=-1.83; 95\% CI, 3.14 to 0.53; P=.006).
   The number of potential caregivers was only significantly associated
   with rehabilitation effectiveness at the bivariate level (P=.006).
   Conclusions: Caregiver identity, and possibly availability, appears to
   negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes in subacute stroke. A better
   understanding of these relationships has potential implications on
   clinical practice and policy directions. (C) 2016 by the American

Abstract = {Objectives: This study was designed to determine the caregiver-proxy
   reliability of the Igbo-culture adapted urban version of the Maleka
   Stroke Community Reintegration Measure (I-MSCRIM).
   Methods: This was a validation study involving 74 consenting stroke
   survivors and their 74 primary informal caregivers consecutively
   recruited from selected tertiary hospitals in South-East Nigeria
   (Igboland). The I-MSCRIM was researcher-administered to the
   participants. Obtained data was analyzed using frequency counts,
   percentages, range, mean, standard deviation, Spearman rank order
   correlation, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Intra-class
   Correlation Coefficient. Alpha level was set at 0.05.
   Results: The mean ages of the stroke survivors (55.4\% males) and their
   primary informal caregivers (41.9\% males) were 50.1412.24 and 31.93 +/-
   10.9years respectively. There was no significant difference in the
   community reintegration (CR) scores as rated by stroke survivors and
   their primary informal caregivers (p>0.05). The correlations between
   stroke survivors' and primary informal caregivers' rated CR scores were
   all adequate and acceptable (ICC=0.602-0.917). The discrepancy in the
   total CR scores between the two ratings was significantly influenced by
   primary informal caregivers' educational attainment (k=13.15; p<0.01).
   Conclusion: The I-MSCRIM has acceptable caregiver-proxy reliability
   among Igbo stroke survivors in South-East Nigeria. This suggests that
   primary informal caregivers of stroke survivors can reliably estimate
   the CR of their care recipients when I-MSCRIM is administered to them.
   This will be useful when a stroke survivor cannot respond to I-MSCRIM.},

Abstract = {Background: Identifying patients' and caregivers' learning needs and
   perspectives on provided education activities is vital for the
   development of effective education in rehabilitation, yet it may not be
   deemed important. This study explored the stroke education perspectives
   in a Canadian rehabilitation centre to illustrate one approach for
   addressing this problem.
   Methods: This qualitative description study was overlaid by
   phenomenology; in-depth interviews were transcribed then analysed using
   a foundational thematic analysis approach. The concepts of reflexivity
   and credibility were employed to enhance trustworthiness.
   Findings: Three patients and three caregivers were interviewed. Conveyed
   education focuses included secondary prevention, rate of recovery,
   knowledge collection, adherence to home programmes, transition to home,
   and personal responses to caregiving. Client-centred education,
   including providing personally relevant exercises, facilitating
   interaction with other patients, and incorporating print materials,
   trial discharges, and technology, empowered patients and caregivers to
   benefit from `teachable moments'.
   Conclusions: If education programmes are to achieve expected outcomes,
   input from targeted learners about their learning needs and the
   effectiveness of received education programmes is essential. Qualitative
   description is one approach for gathering information which can yield
   valuable insights for those designing education programmes and
   contribute to improved patient-centred care and rehabilitation outcomes.},

Title = {The meaning of caregiving experience lived by Lebanese family caregivers

Journal = {RECHERCHE EN SOINS INFIRMIERS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {120},
Pages = {88-101},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction : six million of deaths are due today to stroke, while
   stroke survivors will depend on their caregivers at home.
   Background : as the literature noted in, these caregivers meet
   challenges and satisfactions, encouraging them to resort to adaptation
   strategies in order to cope with their care situation.
   Objective : the purpose of this article is to describe and understand
   the experience of Lebanese family caregivers who take care at home of a
   relative stroke survivor.
   Method : using the phenomenological approach of Giorgi (1997), twelve
   interviews were conducted with six family caregivers who have been
   recruited through a rehabilitation center in Beirut.
   Results : eight themes have emerged from the phenomenological analysis:
   the family caregiver burden, the missing social support, the learning
   through his experience of a family caregiver, the contribution to
   caregiving survivor, the selflessness in the caregiving, the gratitude
   in the caregiving, the familiarization with new routines and
   reconciliation with new lifestyle. The proposed essence from this
   phenomenological analysis is: the satisfaction in taking care of the
   stoke survivor by facing challenges and bringing order into the chaos
   caused by the stroke.
   Conclusion : the knowledge gained from this study would allow nurses to
   identify family caregivers at risk in order to help them to adapt to
   their new role as caregivers, and to develop health promotion
   strategies, taking into consideration their experience.},

Abstract = {Perception of caregiver burden among stroke survivors varies based on
   socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. The objectives of this study
   were to identify the burdens among Thai caregivers of older stroke
   survivors, characteristics of caregivers and severity of caregiver
   burden. Caregivers of older stroke survivors were randomly interviewed
   (March-June, 2012). Information on baseline characteristics and
   caregiver burden using Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI) was collected. One
   hundred one participants were assessed. The mean ZBI was 21.6 +/- 14.5
   {[}95\% CI, 18.7-24.8]. More than half of caregivers reported no burden
   (54.5\%). High burdens were associated with low self-reported income,
   high numbers of basic activities of daily living needed and coexisting
   musculoskeletal conditions. The observed low degree of burden might be
   the result of the sociocultural view of the study participants.},

Title = {Men as caregivers for their wives - Two phenomenological studies of the
   experiences of male primary caregivers in home care arrangements. Part
   I: Men as caregivers for their wives after stroke},
Journal = {PFLEGE},

Volume = {27},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: In Germany, men participate more and more in the extensive
   process of caring for their relatives. The ongoing discourse in nursing
   sciences, however, reflects poorly on this increasing number of male
   principal caregivers.
   Aim: Objective of the present study is to analyse the following
   questions, with focus on caring husbands: Firstly, how do caring
   husbands experience caring for their wives after stroke? And secondly,
   how do they organise daily life?
   Method: Narrative interviews with ten caring husbands were conducted.
   Analysis was performed using a modified phenomenological-interpretative
   approach as described by Diekelmann (1992).
   Results: Six central issues evolved: ``I never thought something like
   that'd happen to us ...{''} (disease as acute crisis); ``I see her just
   the way she was when we first met ...{''} (relationship); ``... since
   then I got her in home care.{''} (care); ``... this work, it's never
   been easy{''} (work and burden); ``This new situation, well, you've got
   to adapt ...{''} (adaptation); ``... because I do need some time for
   myself!{''} (support and relief). ``Being responsible{''}emerged as a
   constitutive pattern, according to which caring husbands perceive their
   own life situation.
   Conclusion: Professional nurses should take this constitutive pattern
   seriously and should align their work to it when collaborating with male
   principal care givers. For this purpose, further research is needed to
   develop new approaches to this special situation and its implications.},

Title = {PREDICTORS OF LIFE SATISFACTION AMONG FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF HOSPITALIZED
   FIRST-EVER STROKE PATIENTS IN KELANTAN},

Abstract = {Objective: The involvement of families in assisting health professionals
   in providing care for their family members who suffer a stroke during
   hospitalization is common in Malaysia. Family caregivers are accountable
   in providing for the first-ever stroke survivor's needs, including
   maintaining functional improvements gained in rehabilitation and the
   long-term well-being of the stroke survivors. The objective of this
   study was to determine the predictors of life satisfaction among family
   caregivers of hospitalized first-ever stroke patients. Methods: This was
   a cross-sectional community research design study with purposive
   sampling. It involved 102 family caregivers of hospitalized first-ever
   stroke patients of two tertiary hospitals in Kelantan. The Bakas
   Caregiving Outcomes Score (BCOS) was used to measure life satisfaction.
   Multiple linear regression was used to determine the predictors of life
   satisfaction. Results: Out of 102 respondents, 21 were males and 81 were
   females with age range of 16 to 76 years. Significant predictors of life
   satisfaction of caregivers while caring for their hospitalized
   first-ever stroke family members were caregivers' health (beta -2.875,
   95\% CI: -5.725, -0.025, p = 0.048), patients' age (beta -4.251, 95\%
   CI: -6.379, -2.123, p<0.001) and educational status of patients (beta
   3.176, 95\% CI: 1.083, 5.269, p = 0.003). Conclusion: This study
   highlighted predictors of life satisfaction among caregivers while
   caring for their hospitalized family members with stroke. The results
   may provide a basis for developing a support program for the family
   caregivers of hospitalized stroke patients in preparation for their
   continuing caregiving role at their homes.},

   factors that influence caregivers' quality of life six to 36 months post
   stroke.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study which included 35 patients six
   to 36 months post stroke and their primary caregiver utilising a sample
   of convenience from local clinics/hospitals in Johannesburg. Demographic
   information was obtained from the patient and the caregiver using a
   questionnaire. The Barthel Index (BI), Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) and
   the EQ-5D were also administered.
   Results: On the BI, 60\% of the patients were moderately dependent to
   independent while 77\% of the caregivers were strained. Older caregivers
   were 81\% more likely to experience a decrease in quality of life than
   younger caregivers.
   Conclusion: A large proportion of patients are discharged from hospital
   without receving rehabilitation and are still dependent on caregivers
   six to 36 months post stroke. Caregivers of patients with stroke need
   more support from health professionals to mitigate against the high
   strain and low quality of life that they experience when caring for
   patients six to 36 months post stroke.},

Abstract = {Reliability of caregivers in assessing the quality of life of stroke
   survivors: an explorative study. Introduction. Not all stroke survivors
   are able to assess their quality of life (QOL), thus a caregiver could
   provide important information on patients' QOL. Objective. To assess
   caregiver's reliability in measuring QOL in stroke survivors. Method.
   Fifty (50) patient-caregiver dyads were recruited. Patients,
   hospitalized in rehabilitation facilities, were administered the Stroke
   Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS 3.0) patient version, the Barthel Index, the
   Modified Rankin Scale, and the National Institute of Health Stroke
   Scale. Caregivers completed the SIS 3.0 proxy version. Results. The mean
   scores of the SIS 3.0 patient version were very similar to the proxy
   version and ranged from 19.1 vs 16.2 for the Hand function domain to
   83.81 vs 81.85 for the Communication domain. Caregivers tended to
   underestimate patients' QOL although scores were not significantly
   different. Intraclass correlations between the patient version and the
   proxy version of the SIS 3.0 were highly significant (p<0.001), with
   coefficient over 0.80. Lower coefficients were observed for the Social
   participation (0.58), Emotion (0.64) and Communication (0.79) domains.
   Conclusions. Caregivers were more reliable in assessing the physical
   rather than psychosocial domains.},

Abstract = {Aim:
   To investigate family caregiver perceptions of allied health
   professional processes of care and support in hospital following stroke,
   and to test an adapted version of the Measure of Processes of Care
   (MPOC) for its suitability of use in the stroke care setting.
   Methods:
   The first stage involved the adaptation and refinement of the MPOC,
   designed to measure caregiver perceptions of processes of professional
   care and support across five care dimensions. The second stage involved
   mailing out of questionnaires to primary caregivers of stroke survivors.
   A total of 107 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis.
   The reliability of the adapted questionnaire was assessed and summary
   statistics were computed.
   Results:
   The reliability of the adapted MPOC was found to be high, with good
   internal consistency of items within each subscale. Mean scores
   indicated that caregivers were most likely to report negative
   perceptions of the way allied health professionals engaged with and
   supported them, particularly in the area of information provision.
   Conclusion:
   The number of families being affected by stroke is predicted to rise
   substantially in the near future. Allied health professionals have a
   significant role to play in supporting family caregivers. Results
   highlight caregiver-identified areas of weakness in current clinical
   practice.},

Abstract = {Caregiver education program has been applied to stroke patients, while
   its effect on mental health in stroke patients is still obscure. This
   study aimed to assess the impact of the WeChat-based caregiver education
   (WBCE) program on cognition, anxiety, and depression in stroke patients.
   Totally, 170 patients with ischemic stroke were included. They were
   randomized at a 1:1 ratio to the WBCE group (N = 86) and control care
   (CC) group (N = 84), and their caregivers received WBCE or CC for 12
   months, respectively. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was
   increased in the WBCE group compared with that in the CC group at the
   9(th) month (M9) (27.2 +/- 1.9 vs 26.6 +/- 1.6, P = 0.017) and M12 (27.1
   +/- 1.8 vs 26.5 +/- 1.5, P = 0.015), while cognitive impairment rate was
   decreased in WBCE group compared with that in CC group at 12(th) month
   (M12) (30.2\% vs 45.2\%, P=0.043). In the meantime, the Hospital Anxiety
   and Depression Scale (HADS) for Anxiety score (6.5 +/- 3.1 vs 7.5 +/-
   2.8, P = 0.020), HADS for depression score (6.7 +/- 3.1 vs 7.7 +/- 3.3,
   P = 0.040) and depression rate (33.7\% vs 48.8\%, P = 0.046) in WBCE
   group were reduced compared with those in CC group at M12. Besides, an
   elevation in the satisfaction score of patients at M12 (8.0 +/- 1.2 vs
   7.4 +/- 1.2, P = 0.002) and that of caregivers at 6(th) months (M6) (6.6
   +/- 1.1 vs 6.2 +/- 1.3, P = 0.038) and M12 (7.2 +/- 1.1 vs 6.8 +/- 1.4,
   P=0.042) were found in WBCE group compared with CC group. WBCE program
   not only improves the satisfaction of stroke patients and caregivers but
   also attenuates cognitive impairment and depression in stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Objectives The primary objective was to gain insight into the lived
   experiences of using day-to-day strategies to manage post-stroke
   fatigue. Design Qualitative, descriptive study. Setting Community
   telephone interviews. Participants A purposive sample of 20 stroke
   survivors with current, or previous, post-stroke fatigue, and 8
   caregivers, who provided informal care or support, were recruited. Main
   Measures Semi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken. Data were
   analysed using a framework approach. Results Most participants had found
   their own ways of coping and their personal strategies included
   acceptance of having fatigue; `pacing' (spreading activities out and
   interspersing with rest periods); keeping a diary in order to plan
   activities and to identify `trigger' activities which induced fatigue;
   talking to (and educating) others about having fatigue; using
   relaxation; and accessing professional advice and support. The burden
   placed on caregivers was considerable and they often had to oversee the
   post-stroke fatigue management strategies used. Conclusions Post-stroke
   fatigue is managed in different ways and there was not one particular
   strategy that seemed effective for everyone. Most people in our study
   had had to devise their own ways of coping practically. Given the scale
   of this problem, which profoundly impacts the lives of both stroke
   survivors and caregivers, the management of post-stroke fatigue merits
   more attention and evaluation. However, this must be directly informed
   by those with lived experience.},

Title = {The experience of stroke survivors and caregivers during
   hospital-to-home transitional care: A qualitative longitudinal study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors and their caregivers experience different
   difficulties that arise from certain physical, psychological, social
   aspects and caring burdens during the hospital-to-home transitional
   period. Although there are abundant studies that focus on stroke
   transitional care, there are limited qualitative studies that synthesize
   the experience of hospital-to-home transitional care for stroke
   survivors and their caregivers in China.Objective: To evaluate the
   experience of stroke survivors and their family caregivers during
   hospital-to home transitional care in China.Methods: A qualitative
   longitudinal study based on semi-structured interviews were implemented
   to address the research objective. Interviews were conducted at two
   stages, (1) when stroke survivors were close to discharge, and (2)
   within two months post-discharge. Participants were recruited from one
   tertiary hospital between April and September 2019. Data were analyzed
   using reflexive thematic analysis.Findings: Twenty-three stroke
   survivor/caregiver dyads participated, totaling 92 individual
   interviews. The thematic framework based on the experience of stroke
   survivors and caregivers reveals a three-phases of the hospital-to-home
   trajectory: survived, living in the mist, and crisis at home. The study
   identified one key theme (the optimism and hope) in the first phase,
   four key themes in the second (the pre-discharge emotional concerns and
   reactions, lack of stroke knowledge and stroke care information,
   difficulties of performing home-based healthcare, expectation of
   hospital pre-discharge) and in the third phase (high level of
   post-discharge stress, inaccessible postdischarge care services and
   health resources, interpersonal relationship disruption and lifestyle
   changes, financial burdens) respectively. In addition, several
   interconnected subthemes for stroke survivors' and caregivers'
   experiences were identified in each phase.Conclusion: The experience of
   stroke survivors and caregivers during hospital-to-home transitional
   care is a dynamic process with enormous challenges in each phase. These
   findings have implications for policy makers and health care systems
   regarding developing an enabling environment that supports successful
   hospital-to-home transitional care. Collaboration with health care
   professionals, accessible rehabilitation services and follow-up support
   after discharge, and available community and social support are
   warranted to be integrated into transitional care to help stroke
   survivors and caregivers to facilitate their hospital-to-home
   trajectory.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background Studies have found that caregivers can influence stroke
   survivors' outcomes, such as mortality. It is thus pertinent to identify
   significant factors associated with caregivers' outcomes. The study
   objective was to examine the associations between caregivers'
   psychosocial characteristics and caregivers' depressive symptoms.
   Methods The analysis obtained three-month and one-year post-stroke data
   from the Singapore Stroke Study, which was collected from hospital
   settings. Caregivers' depressive symptoms were assessed via the Center
   for Epidemiologic Studies Depression instrument. Psychosocial
   characteristics of caregivers included subjective burden (Zarit Burden
   Interview), quality of care-relationship (a modified 3-item scale from
   the University of Southern California Longitudinal Study of
   Three-Generation Families) and expressive social support (an 8-item
   scale from Pearlin et al.). Mixed effect Tobit regressions were used to
   examine the associations between these study variables. Results A total
   of 214 caregivers of stroke patients hospitalized were included in the
   final analysis. Most caregivers were Chinese women with secondary school
   education, unemployed and married to the patients. Caregivers'
   subjective burden was positively associated with their depressive
   symptoms (Partial regression coefficient: 0.18, 95\% CI 0.11-0.24).
   Quality of care-relationship (Partial regression coefficient: - 0.35,
   95\% CI - 0.63 to - 0.06) and expressive social support (partial
   regression coefficient: - 0.28, 95\% CI - 0.37 to - 0.19) were
   negatively associated with caregivers' depressive symptoms. Caregivers'
   depressive symptoms were higher at three-month post-stroke than one-year
   post-stroke (Partial regression coefficient: - 1.00, 95\% CI - 1.80 to -
   0.20). Conclusion The study identified subjective burden, quality of
   care-relationship and expressive social support as significantly
   associated with caregivers' depressive symptoms. Caregivers'
   communication skills may also play a role in reducing caregivers'
   depressive symptoms.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a high burden illness and the second leading cause
   of worldwide disability with generally poor recovery rates. Robust
   benefits of hippotherapy, a novel neurorehabilitation approach, in
   functional recovery following various severe neurological disabling
   conditions has been shown. In the present study, we will analyze the
   effect of a hippotherapy program on the outcome of post-stroke patients
   in the first year post-stroke. Method: A randomized controlled clinical
   trial on the effectiveness of hippotherapy (4 weeks/18 weeks
   hippotherapy/conventional neurorehabilitation) versus conventional
   neurorehabilitation alone (22 weeks) will be conducted over 48 weeks. In
   the treated group, one-hour daily hippotherapy sessions will be
   exclusively conducted during the hippotherapy's cycles, alternated with
   periods of conventional neurorehabilitation. A test battery will measure
   both the functional and psychological outcomes. The primary endpoint
   will be the patient's functional independence. The secondary endpoints
   will measure the sensorimotor function, autonomy, and quality of life,
   as well as the caregivers' quality of life. Results and conclusion:
   Individual brain connectome, life history and personality construct
   influence the brain's functional connectivity and are central to
   developing optimal tailored neurorehabilitation strategies. According to
   our current practice, hippotherapy allows the enhancement of substantial
   neuroplastic changes in the injured brain with significant neurological
   recovery. The protocol aims to confirm those issues. Trial registration

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to incorporate a
   person-centered approach to understand the emotional health needs and
   perspectives of stroke survivors (SSs) and their caregivers. METHODS: In
   collaboration with 4 SSs and caregivers as research partners,
   quantitative data were collected to assess poststroke emotional health
   needs, and qualitative data were collected to gain insight into SS and
   caregiver emotional health perspectives after stroke. RESULTS: Forty
   surveys (n = 26 SSs, n = 14 caregivers) were collected. The predominate
   emotional health needs were frustration (65\%), anxiety (54\%), and
   stress (50\%) for SSs and stress (71\%), worry (57\%), and frustration
   (57\%) for caregivers. Two group interviews (n = 7 SSs, n = 3
   caregivers) were completed. Four emerging themes were identified:
   receiving support from those in similar situations, poststroke emotional
   responses, situations experienced in healthcare settings, and a
   hypervigilance for sudden and unexpected events. CONCLUSION: Emotional
   healthcare services for SSs and their caregivers may consider providing
   reoccurring mental health education and multifaceted treatment
   approaches, including provision of peer support, and addressing the
   unique emotional stressors SSs and caregivers may be experiencing. The
   small sample size precludes generalizing the results into the broader
   stroke population. However, by leveraging the lived experience of SSs
   and their caregivers, the results may help find ways to support SSs' and
   caregivers' emotional health.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Stroke is the leading cause of adult lifelong disability worldwide. A
   stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease with a variety of causes and
   corresponding clinical symptoms. Around 75\% of surviving stroke
   patients experience impaired nerve function, and some suffer from
   traumatic fractures, which can lead to special care needs.
   AIM
   To determine the effect of timing theory continuous care, with
   resistance training, on the rehabilitation and mental health of
   caregivers and stroke patients with traumatic fractures.
   METHODS
   Between January 2017 to March 2021, we selected 100 hospital admissions
   with post-stroke hemiplegia complicated with a traumatic fracture. Two
   participant groups were created: (1) Control group: given resistance
   training; and (2) Observation group: given timing theory continuous care
   combined with resistance training. The degree of satisfaction and
   differences in bone and phosphorus metabolism indexes between the two
   groups were compared. The self-perceived burden scale (SPBS) and
   caregiver burden questionnaire were used to evaluate the psychological
   health of patients and caregivers. The Harris hip function score,
   ability of daily living (ADL) scale, and global quality of life
   questionnaire (GQOL-74) were used to evaluate hip function, ability of
   daily living, and quality of life.
   RESULTS
   Data were collected prior to and after intervention. Alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, and vitamin D3 in the observation group
   and control group increased after intervention (P < 0.05), and
   carboxy-terminal peptide of type I collagen beta Special sequence
   (beta-CTX) decreased (P < 0.05). ALP and osteocalcin in the observation
   group were higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no
   significant difference in beta-CTX and vitamin D3 between the two groups
   (P > 0.05). The SPBS score of the observation group was lower and the
   ADL score was higher than the control group. The burden score was lower
   and the Harris hip function and GQOL-74 scores were higher than that of
   the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group's satisfaction
   rating was 94.00\%, which was higher than the rating from the control
   group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION
   Timing theory continuous nursing with resistance training can reduce hip
   dysfunction in stroke patients with a traumatic fracture and enhance
   quality of life and mental health of patients and caregivers.},

Abstract = {Background In China, family caregivers are usually the main carers of
   relatives after stroke due to traditional Chinese culture and the
   limited development of the primary healthcare system. This
   responsibility often results in burdens and negative health outcomes.
   However, family caregivers seldom receive support. To improve informal
   care, as well as the health and well-being of family caregivers, it is
   important to identify their needs. Objective This study aimed to
   deductively explore the needs of family members caring for stroke
   survivors in China. Methods Twenty-six semi-structured interviews were
   performed with family caregivers of stroke survivors who were selected
   from one city and three communities by purposive sampling. A deductive
   qualitative content analysis method was performed by using the Caregiver
   Task Inventory-25 (CTI-25), an instrument measuring the needs of family
   caregivers, as a framework. Results All subscales, as well as all
   belonging items in the CTI-25, were identified in the present study,
   meaning that the family caregivers had needs related to learning to cope
   with new role, providing care according to care-receiver's needs,
   managing own emotional needs, appraising supportive resources, and
   balancing caregiving needs and one's own needs. Moreover, needs related
   to financial support, both direct and indirect, were identified but not
   part of the CTI-25. Conclusion These findings identified that family
   caregivers of stroke survivors in China had various needs, which is
   important knowledge when assessing needs and improving health care for
   family caregivers. Cultural adjustments and modifications should be made
   if CTI-25 is used in mainland China. This study also indicated a
   comprehensive and holistic perspective (individual, community, and
   social level) when identifying, assessing needs or implementing
   interventions to support family caregivers.},

Abstract = {Introduction Even in nonpandemic times, persons with disabilities
   experience emotional and behavioral disturbances which are distressing
   for them and for their close persons. We aimed at comparing the levels
   of stress in emotional and behavioral aspects, before and during
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as reported by informal family
   caregivers of individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) or
   stroke living in the community, considering two different
   stratifications of the recipients of care (cause and injury severity).
   Methods We conducted a STROBE-compliant prospective observational study
   analyzing informal caregivers of individuals with stroke (IC-STROKE) or
   traumatic brain injury (IC-TBI). IC-STROKE and IC-TBI were assessed
   in-person before and during COVID-19 online, using the Head Injury
   Behavior Scale (HIBS). The HIBS comprises behavioral and emotional
   subtotals (10 items each) and a total-HIBS. Comparisons were performed
   using the McNemar's test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test or t-test.
   Recipients of care were stratified according to their injury severity
   using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the
   Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Results One hundred twenty-two informal
   caregivers (62.3\% IC-STROKE and 37.7\% IC-TBI) were assessed online
   between June 2020 and April 2021 and compared to their own assessments
   performed in-person 1.74 +/- 0.88 years before the COVID-19 lockdown.
   IC-STROKE significantly increased their level of stress during COVID-19
   in five emotional items (impatience, frequent complaining, often
   disputes topics, mood change and overly sensitive) and in one behavioral
   item (overly dependent). IC-TBI stress level only increased in one
   behavioral item (impulsivity). By injury severity, (i) mild (14.7\%)
   showed no significant differences in emotional and behavioral either
   total-HIBS (ii) moderate (28.7\%) showed significant emotional
   differences in two items (frequent complaining and mood change) and
   (iii) severe (56.6\%) showed significant differences in emotional (often
   disputes topics) and behavioral (impulsivity) items. Conclusions Our
   results suggest specific items in which informal caregivers could be
   supported considering cause or severity of the recipients of care.},

Abstract = {Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in
   reducing psychological morbidities such as depressive symptomology,
   anxiety, burden and improving quality of life and self-efficacy in
   informal caregivers of stroke survivors. Design A systematic review and
   meta-analysis. Data Sources An extensive search was systematically
   undertaken at CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINHAL, Web of Science
   and PsycInfo until January 2021. Grey literature and dissertations were
   searched in Google Scholar, ProQuest \& Scholarbank@NUS. Studies
   involving registered trials were retrieved from Clinicaltrials.gov and
   CENTRAL, respectively. Review Methods Two reviewers independently
   screened the trials, conducted quality appraisal and extracted the data.
   Quality of the studies included in the review was assessed using
   Cochrane Risk of bias tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan
   5.4. Narrative synthesis was performed for studies where results could
   not be pooled statistically. The results were reported abiding Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
   Results This review included 15 trials with a total of 1276 informal
   caregivers of stroke survivors. Eleven trials were included in the
   meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses revealed that technology-based
   interventions with structured educational programs were statistically
   significant in reducing depressive symptoms (d = -0.27, 95\% CI {[}-0.49
   to -0.05], p = .02). Technology-based interventions with structured
   educational programs <3-month revealed significant effects (d = -0.31,
   95\% CI {[}-0.49 to -0.13], p = .0009). Results of narrative synthesis
   reported technology-based intervention with face-to-face training
   minimized depressive symptoms of informal caregivers. Notably, there
   were no statistically significant effects on anxiety, burden, quality of
   life and self-efficacy outcomes. Conclusion Technology-based
   interventions had beneficial effects in alleviating depressive symptoms
   among informal caregivers. Impact Technology-based interventions serve
   as a support mechanism for informal caregivers of stroke survivors who
   face time-constrains. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials
   are warranted to elucidate sustainability, optimal format and dosage of
   intervention.},

Title = {Examining the Influence of Social Interactions and Community Resources
   on Caregivers' Burden in Stroke Settings: A Prospective Cohort Study},

Abstract = {Since the introduction of the integrated care model, understanding how
   social interactions and community resources can alleviate caregivers'
   burden is vital to minimizing negative patients' outcomes. This study (n
   = 214) examined the associations between these factors and caregivers'
   burden in stroke settings. It used 3-month and 1-year post-stroke data
   collected from five tertiary hospitals. Subjective and objective
   caregivers' burdens were measured using Zarit burden interview and
   Oberst caregiving burden scale respectively. The independent variables
   examined were quality of care relationship, care management strategies
   for managing patients' behaviour, family caregiving conflict, formal
   service usage and assistance to the caregiver. Significant associations
   were determined using mixed effect modified Poisson regressions. For
   both types of burden, the scores were slightly higher at 3 months as
   compared to 1 year. Poorer care-relationship (relative risk: 0.81, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.94) and adopting positive care
   management strategies (relative risk: 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.07) were
   independently associated with a high subjective burden. Providing
   assistance to caregivers (relative risk: 2.45, 95\% CI: 1.72-3.29) and
   adopting positive care management strategies (relative risk: 1.03, 95\%
   CI: 1.02-1.04) were independently associated with a high objective
   burden. Adopting positive care management strategies at 3 months had a
   significant indirect effect (standardised beta: 0.11, 95\% CI: 0.01 to
   0.20) on high objective burden at one year. Healthcare providers should
   be aware that excessive care management strategies and assistance from
   family members may add to caregivers' burden.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: This systematic review aimed to identify and
   appraise the evidence for online peer-support interventions for
   caregivers of stroke survivors (with and without aphasia), and people
   with dementia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Parkinson's disease and
   multiple sclerosis. Research Design and Methods: Systematic review
   conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Five databases were
   systematically searched up until September 2020: EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL,
   Scopus and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened titles,
   abstracts and full-text articles. The methodological quality of included
   studies was assessed using Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and
   Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) scales. Interventions were described
   using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR)
   checklist. Results: A total of 3026 records were identified from
   database searches. Following screening, 18 studies reporting 17
   interventions were included in this review. Most studies (n = 13)
   reported interventions for caregivers of people with dementia. All
   studies incorporated an element of peer support as part of the
   intervention, however, most interventions (n = 15) comprised both
   psychosocial and educational elements. Statistically significant changes
   were reported for 11 interventions in one or more of the following
   domains: caregiver knowledge, mental health, stress, depression,
   distress, burden, self-efficacy, mastery, helplessness and perceived
   support. Qualitative outcomes included perceived reductions in stress
   and increased emotional and informational support. Discussion and
   Implications: Positive changes in caregiver outcomes were identified in
   response to multi-component online interventions (i.e., peer support in
   addition to education). Peer support was often poorly described,
   limiting the conclusions that could be drawn about the intervention
   components which result in better outcomes. Online interventions may
   provide an accessible and effective means of supporting caregivers.},

Title = {Seeking healthcare services post-stroke: a qualitative descriptive study
   exploring family caregiver and stroke survivor perspectives in an asian

Abstract = {Aim Exploration of the healthcare journey post-stroke is incomplete
   without acknowledging the crucial role of family caregivers. With
   limited literature documenting the role of caregivers in the healthcare
   journey post-stroke, we aimed to describe the healthcare experiences of
   family caregivers and stroke survivors across different caregiver
   identities in Singapore. Methods We conducted a qualitative descriptive
   study involving semi-structured interviews with transcripts analysed
   using thematic analysis. 26 stroke survivors and 35 family caregivers
   purposively sampled from multiple settings. Results Findings were
   summarized into seeking care and experience of healthcare encounters.
   Seeking care comprised of the following themes: factors influencing
   seeking care, decision to seek care and role of caregiver in seeking
   care. Experience of healthcare encounters comprised of the following
   themes: service around the patient, service with care and role of
   caregiver in healthcare encounters. Conclusion Multi-dimensional role of
   caregivers in healthcare experience emerged as a major finding. Unique
   to our Asian context, as per the participants' accounts, family
   caregivers seemed to be central in healthcare decision-making for stroke
   survivors, with adult-child caregivers commonly reported being engaged
   in collaborative decision-making. While spousal caregivers preferred a
   relational healthcare experience, adult-child caregivers preferred a
   transactional one. Practical implications include equipping caregivers
   with skillset to make healthcare decisions, provision of supportive
   decision-making environment for caregivers and reinforcing communication
   aspects in the medical, nursing and allied healthcare curriculum to
   improve healthcare experience.},

Abstract = {Background Caregiving is a global phenomenon which is bound to increase
   in tandem with the aging population worldwide. Stroke is a condition
   common in older people that requires complex caregiving necessitating
   provision of adequate support to the caregivers. Past literature
   consists of limited accounts of types and organization of support
   arrangements needed by different caregivers. We aimed to describe the
   support system of caregivers of stroke survivors in Singapore,
   highlighting differences across the different caregiver identities (i.e.
   spouse, adult-child, etc.). Methods We conducted a qualitative
   descriptive study in the community setting involving 61 purposively
   sampled and recruited stroke survivors and caregivers. Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted, and transcripts were analysed using thematic
   analysis. Results Our findings were summarized across the following 4
   themes: 1) cultural influence and caregiving; 2) caregiver support
   system with the following sub-themes: 2.1) dyadic caregiver support
   type, 2.2) extended caregiver support type, 2.3.) distributed caregiver
   support type and 2.4) empowering caregiver support type; 3) breaks in
   care of stroke survivor and 4) complex relationship dynamics. We
   operationalized the caregiver support system as comprising of type,
   people and activities that enable the caregiver to participate in
   caregiving activities sustainably. While spouse caregivers preferred
   dyadic and extended support systems positioning themselves in a more
   central caregiving role, adult-child caregivers preferred distributed
   support system involving family members with paid caregivers playing a
   more central role. Conclusions Our findings highlight caregiver identity
   as a surrogate for the differences in the caregiver support systems.
   Practical implications include imparting relationship-building skills to
   the stroke survivor-caregiver dyads to sustain dyadic support system and
   educating clinicians to include differences in caregiving arrangements
   of stroke survivors in practising family-centred care.},

Abstract = {Stroke family caregivers often neglect their own health while providing
   care. Rigorous reviews have focused on stroke caregiver needs and
   outcomes; however, a comprehensive review of stroke caregiver health is
   lacking. The purpose of this integrative review was to determine factors
   associated with stroke family caregiver health. Using a PRISMA flow
   diagram and Rayyan software, 41 studies were identified published from
   January 2000 to December 2020. Databases included Cochrane Reviews,
   Cochrane Trials, PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EBSCOhost MEDLINE,
   Embase, and CINAHL. Rigorous guidelines were used to critique the 41
   articles. Health measures were global in nature, lacking details
   regarding health promotion activities important to stroke family
   caregiver health. Common factors associated with caregiver health were
   depressive symptoms and burden. Further research is needed to design
   more situation-specific instruments to measure stroke family caregiver
   health, as well as interventions to reduce depressive symptoms and
   burden while promoting caregiver health.},

Abstract = {Objectives Stroke is a significant global public health challenge
   attributable to an array of disabilities it causes alongside an
   impairment in cognition. The monetary impact of stroke care includes
   acute treatment expenses as well as outrageous expenses of postdischarge
   chronic hospital care and rehabilitation services. The current study
   aimed to study the perceptions along with experiences of stroke
   survivors and caregivers.
   Materials and Methods In-depth interviews (ID's) of stroke survivors and
   their primary caregivers were conducted at their home 2 months after
   their discharge from the hospital in Bhopal, India. These IDls were
   later analyzed.
   Results The following eight themes emerged: pervasive and irreversible,
   multifunction loss and dependency, holistic impact on the health of
   person and family, money and matter, nonaccommodative cost and baffled
   belief, professional paralysis, social crisis, and slow and obscured
   progress. The added obligation of taking care of a disabled stroke
   survivor along with adjusting their own lifestyle with financial
   apprehensions, worry about future, prolonged hours of care, and stress
   are major factors that increase the burden of the caregivers.
   Conclusion Caregivers should be sensitized with proper counseling and
   training through health care institutions to ensure appropriate care and
   management of stroke survivors at home, as it will also help in
   addressing their psychosocial needs, and minimizing the knowledge gap,
   doubts and uncertainties about the disease and its aftereffects.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Stroke constitutes a significant public health problem in
   developing countries. Caregivers provide an important support system for
   patient care but usually lack knowledge and skill to attend their stroke
   patients. We assessed whether a caregiverdirected educational
   intervention would reduce hospital-acquired complications and improve
   stroke patients' outcomes. Materials and methods: We randomly assigned
   two Neurology inpatient wards to receive either standard care or an
   educational intervention. The coprimary outcomes included incidence of
   hospital-acquired complications and inhospital mortality. Secondary
   outcomes included the modified Rankin Scale and mortality at three
   months. Results: Among 164 patients recruited, 82 received intervention,
   and standard care each. The mean (Standard deviation) Glasgow coma scale
   of patients was 11.01 (3.4), and National Institute of Health Stroke
   Scale was 19.17 (8.54). The incidence of complications (72 in the
   intervention versus 81 in the control group; p=0.56) was not different.
   Ten patients (12.2\%) in the intervention group and 16 (19.5\%) in the
   control group (p=0.20) died in-hospital. Twenty patients (27.8\%) in the
   intervention and twelve (18.2\%) in the control group attained modified
   Rankin Scale 0-2 at three months (p=0.12). The mortality at three months
   (20 {[}24.4\%] in the intervention versus 25 {[}30.5\%] in the control
   group) was not different (p=0.38). The intervention group had fewer
   complications (42 versus 68 in the control group; p=0.01) during the
   initial ten days of hospital stay, but adjusted analysis revealed no
   difference. Conclusion: A structured educational intervention did not
   reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired complications, mortality, or
   morbidity. However, there was a trend towards fewer complications in the
   initial days of hospital stay. Extended hospital stay, caregiver
   fatigue, and dilution of the intervention over time might be reasons for
   the apparent lack of effect. Clinical trial registration-URL:

Title = {Empowerment in Chinese primary caregivers of post-stroke patients with
   disability A cross-sectional study},
Journal = {MEDICINE},

Abstract = {To investigate the status quo of empowerment ability of primary
   caregivers in post-stroke patients with disability and its influencing
   factors. A cross-sectional design and a convenience sample were used.
   Participants (N = 189) from 3 hospital in Beijing were recruited from
   October 2018 to June 2019. The following measurement tools were used in
   this study: Barthel index, Main Caregiver Empowerment Measurement,
   General Self-Efficacy Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and
   Social Support Rating Scale. Multiple linear stepwise regression
   analysis was used to statistically infer the influencing factors of
   empowerment ability of primary caregivers. The total score of main
   caregivers' empowerment measurement among the participants was 161.03
   +/- 14.678, the median (interquartile range) score was 162.00
   (150.00-171.50). The average scores of each dimension ranged from high
   to low: relationship with the person being cared for, goodwill care,
   expectation for care outcomes, subjectivity of caregiver, faith in care,
   understanding of care role, knowledge and skills of care, scruples about
   the surroundings, personal resources. The single factor analysis showed
   that the patient's payment method for medical expenses, whether the
   patient accompanied by other chronic diseases and the gender of the
   caregiver had an effect on the empowerment ability of primary
   caregivers, and the positive coping style, negative coping style,
   self-efficacy and subjective support of primary caregivers were
   positively correlated with their empowerment ability (P < .05). Multiple
   linear stepwise regression analysis showed that the type of payment for
   treatment of patients (b = 7.449, P < .01), and gender of caregivers (b
   = 5.039, P < .05), subjective support of caregivers (b = 0.439, P <
   .05), positive coping style of caregivers (b = 0.585, P < .01),
   self-efficacy of caregivers (b = 6.456, P < .01) were the main
   influencing factors of empowerment ability of primary caregivers. The
   empowerment ability of the primary caregivers of post-stroke patients
   with disability in China is at the upper middle level. However, there
   are more scruples about the surrounding and less personal resources,
   which deserve attention. Furthermore, the identification of the factors
   related to empowerment lays a foundation for clinical nursing
   practitioners to further develop targeted interventions on empowerment
   of caregivers.},

Abstract = {This study intended to discover the effect of education and muscle
   relaxation (EMR) program on anxiety, depression and care burden among
   caregivers of acute stroke survivors. This randomized, controlled study
   enrolled a total of 110 caregivers of first-ever acute stroke patients,
   and randomly assigned to EMR (N = 55) and control (N = 55) groups. The
   caregivers in the EMR group received 12-month health education and
   progressive muscle relaxation, and those in control group were provided
   common rehabilitation advices. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
   (HADS) and Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale in caregivers were evaluated at
   the time of patients' discharge from hospital (M0), then at month(M) 3,
   M6 and M12 after the discharge. HADS-anxiety score, anxiety rate and
   severity were similar at M0, M3, while were reduced at M6 and M12 in EMR
   group compared to control group. Furthermore, HADS-depression score was
   similar at M0 and M3 but was decreased at M6 and M12 in EMR group
   compared with control group, however, there was no difference of
   depression rate and severity between the 2 groups at each time point.
   Moreover, Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale score was similar at M0 and M3,
   but was decreased at M6 and M12; meanwhile, degree of care burden was
   similar at M0, M3 and M6, but was reduced at M12 in EMR group compared
   to control group. EMR program decreases anxiety, depression and care
   burden in caregivers of acute stroke survivors, suggesting its potential
   in improving mental health and further promoting quality of lives in
   these caregivers.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a global health problem. Patients with stroke may
   be damaged in many aspects of life, which affects the physical,
   psychological and social dimensions of quality of life. These factors
   lead to burden on the caregivers. This burden on the caregivers
   negatively affects the rehabilitation of the stroke patients.
   Objective: To study the quality of life of stroke patients and burden on
   caregivers.
   Methods: Stroke patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assessed
   for the quality of life by the Stroke Specific Quality Of Life Scale and
   the burden on caregivers was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview
   on one to one interview basis. The data were analysed using the SPSS
   software.
   Results: The quality of life and burden scores were weakly correlated
   (r= -0.558 and p= 0.001). The quality of life and burden scores were
   also weakly correlated to the MMSE scores.
   Conclusion: There is a negative correlation of the burden on caregivers
   with the quality of life of the stroke patients. There is also a
   positive correlation of MMSE score with the quality of life. Whereas,
   there is no correlation of the quality of life and burden scores with
   the patient's age and sex, type of stroke, duration post stroke and
   whether any treatment has been taken.},

Abstract = {Grit is defined as perseverance and long-term focus on goals. Grit may
   be helpful in surviving stroke for both survivors and caregivers. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the level of grit among
   survivors of stroke and caregivers using health humanities to gain a
   deeper understanding of the lived experience of stroke survivors. A
   sample of convenience was used. Phase I (n = 22) utilized the Grit Scale
   survey. Phase II (n = 6) utilized phenomenological interviews. The Grit
   Scale survey data were analyzed with SPSS 25. Qualitative data were
   analyzed with the whole-parts-whole method of Giorgi, Dahlberg, Drew,
   and Nystrom. Grit scores were high for both survivors of stroke (3.77
   +/- 0.50) and caregivers (3.89 +/- 0.51). Themes emerging from the
   phenomenological interviews included: (a) gritty toughness, (b)
   challenges, (3) accomplishments, and (4) advice for health-care
   providers. Survivors of stroke and caregivers embodied high grit levels.
   Participants articulated the importance of long-term goals despite
   challenges. Understanding grit among survivors and caregivers may help
   clinicians develop best practices to better support these individuals.},

Title = {Family Caregiver's Positive, Negative, and Ambivalent Feelings Towards
   Stroke Survivors: Association with Psychological Well-Being},

Abstract = {Ambivalence is the simultaneous experience of positive and negative
   feelings toward a specific person. Recent research suggested ambivalence
   is negatively associated with psychological well-being, and this
   association was mainly driven by negative feelings and not affected by
   the presence of positive feelings. This paper questioned the assumption
   and aimed to examine the relationship between caregiving ambivalence and
   psychological well-being, by disaggregating the positive and negative
   components of ambivalence. The study comprised data from a
   cross-sectional questionnaire survey with 190 family caregivers of
   stroke survivors (56 +/- 14.3 years old; 70\% female) in Hong Kong. The
   positive feelings and negative feelings towards a care recipient were
   separately measured, and these two composite scores were used to create
   an indirect measure of ambivalence. Psychological well-being was
   measured by caregivers' positive role appraisals and depressive
   symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that the positive
   feeling was associated with positive aspects of caregiving (beta = 0.54,
   p < 0.001) whereas negative feeling was associated with depressive
   symptoms (beta = 0.61, p < 0.001). There was no positive X negative
   interaction on depressive symptoms and positive aspects of caregiving.
   The indirect measure of ambivalence only associated with depressive
   symptoms (beta = 0.75, p < 0.001). Findings indicate the association
   between caregiving ambivalence and psychological well-being is varied by
   dominating valence as well as the method to combine the effects of
   positive and negative feelings. The positive and negative feelings
   associated with corresponding dimensions of psychological well-being but
   not to the opposite-valence outcomes. The indirect measure of
   ambivalence mainly reflects its negative component.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Decompressive hemicraniectomy is a life-saving
   procedure for the treatment of spaceoccupying middle cerebral artery
   infarctions (malignant stroke); however, patients may survive severely
   disabled. Comprehensive data on long-term sequelae outside randomized
   controlled trials are scarce.
   Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the survival rates, quality of
   life, ability to perform activities of daily living, and caregiver
   burden of 61 patients (aged from 37 to 83) who had previously undergone
   decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant stroke between 2012 and
   2017.
   Results: The mortality rate was higher among patients older than 60
   years than among younger patients (71.0 \% vs 36.7 \%, p = 0.007; odds
   ratio 4.222, 95 \% confidence interval 1.443-12.355). The mean survival
   time was 37.9 +/- 6.0 months for 19 survivors of the younger group and
   22.6 +/- 5.7 months for 9 survivors of the older group. Among the 28
   surviving patients, 22 (78.6 \%) were interviewed, and we found that age
   was a determining factor for functional outcome (Barthel indices of 65.7
   +/- 10.6 for younger patients vs 48.0 +/- 9.3 for older patients, p <
   0.001), but not for quality of life. The caregiver burden was
   significantly correlated (R = -0.53, p < 0.01) with the severity of
   disability and age (R = 0.544, p = 0.011) of the patients.
   Conclusion: Our findings show that the degree of impairment, as well as
   caregiver burden, is higher in patients older than 60 years than in
   younger patients.},

Abstract = {Purpose: A strong interpersonal relationship after stroke is important
   for the prevention of depression in survivors and family caregivers.
   This study aimed to test the feasibility of quality of relationship
   intervention for stroke dyads calledHand in Hand(HiH). Methods: Sixteen
   dyads were randomized into either the HiH group (n= 8) or information,
   support, and referral (ISR) control group (n= 8). HiH dyads received up
   to eight sessions, with topics prioritized according to a 17-item
   screening tool. ISR dyads received up to eight sessions that included
   information, active listening, and referrals. Feasibility,
   acceptability, and outcomes data were collected for both groups.
   Results: The HiH and ISR groups were feasible and acceptable. Caregivers
   in both groups, as well as survivors in the ISR group, experienced
   improvements in depressive symptoms and other select outcomes.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that HiH is feasible to implement with
   stroke dyads and that it merits further refinement and testing.},

Abstract = {The effects of caregiver burden during the inpatient rehabilitation
   period have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the burden on stroke survivors' caregivers during the inpatient
   rehabilitation period, and to compare the associations of robot-assisted
   gait training and conventional therapy with caregiver burden. Our
   randomized, crossover, prospective study included 63 stroke survivors
   and their caregivers, who were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
   The patients in group I received robot-assisted gait training for 2
   weeks, followed by conventional therapy for a further 2 weeks. The
   patients in group II received conventional therapy for 2 weeks followed
   by robot-assisted gait training for a further 2 weeks. The caregiver
   burden inventory, beck depression index, and beck hopelessness scale
   were administered to the caregivers at day 0, on the ``switch day{''}
   (day 15), and day 30. Before inpatient rehabilitation, 18 (35\%) of the
   caregivers had somewhat elevated scores on the caregiver burden
   inventory; however, at the end of rehabilitation, 42 (66.6\%) of the
   caregivers were in a high-burden state. The caregiver burden inventory
   scores differed significantly between baseline and the end of
   rehabilitation in both groups. Caregiver depression scores also
   increased significantly in both groups (p < 0.0001), while hopelessness
   scores increased only in group II (p = 0.027). Caregiver burden
   increased during the inpatient stroke rehabilitation period. During
   inpatient rehabilitation, both robot-assisted gait training and
   conventional therapy increased caregiver burden. ClinicalTrials.gov

Abstract = {Perinatal stroke is the most common form of stroke in childhood and is
   followed by a variety of outcomes, with many children experiencing
   specific functional and neuropsychological deficits. The association of
   these outcomes with the psychosocial impact caregivers face is not well
   documented. The goal of our pilot study was to examine caregivers'
   perception of executive behavior and functional abilities among children
   with perinatal stroke, and how these outcomes impact the caregivers. We
   administered three questionnaires to primary caregivers of children with
   perinatal stroke to obtain caregiver-reported measures of (1) executive
   behavior of their child (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
   Function, Second Edition), (2) the functional abilities of their child
   (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test),
   and (3) the psychosocial impact experienced by the caregiver themselves
   (Parental Outcome Measure). Participants included 20 children (mean age
   = 9.3 years, range = 6-16 years) with perinatal stroke and their primary
   caregivers. Functional abilities in the children were rated as
   clinically impaired in the domains of daily activities and mobility.
   Half of the children exhibited clinically impaired ratings on at least
   one executive behavior domain, but the mean scores for these domains did
   not reach clinically impaired levels. Greater ratings of problems in
   daily activities for the child was associated with greater caregiver
   guilt (r= -0.55,p= 0.02). Caregivers of children with perinatal stroke
   who experience limitations in performing daily activities should be more
   closely monitored for adverse impact and be provided the necessary
   support and education to alleviate the associated guilt.},

Abstract = {Objective: The general aim of this study is to identify the events
   experienced by the caregiver (the husband/wife) in providing care to the
   post-stroke partner in Palopo City, South Sulawesi.
   Method: This study is qualitative research using phenomenology design.
   Qualitative study is conducted to find out certain reasons on a topic or
   to understand the occurrence of a topic. The focus of the
   phenomenological approach is on the essence or event experienced by the
   participants.
   Result: The results were processed using NVivo 10; and in terms of
   feelings, it was obtained the feeling of heavy-hearted, angry,
   disappointment, pity, sadness, and normal. The role of the caregivers
   undergoes either changes or no changes. The way of coping with the
   feelings is by accepting the conditions, calming down, talking to
   others, support from the children, the daughters, and other family
   members, praying, and even letting go of the burden. The caregiver
   overcomes the changes in terms of role by managing time and handling the
   situation like it used to.
   Conclusion: Based on the result of the interviews as welt as the data
   analysis, a number of subtheme s were found related to feelings, role
   and ways of overcoming. (C) 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights

Title = {Effect of a tailored multidimensional intervention on the care burden
   among family caregivers of stroke survivors: study protocol for a
   randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Abstract = {Introduction Caring for stroke survivors creates high levels of care
   burden among family caregivers. Previous initiatives at alleviating the
   care burden have been unsuccessful. The proposed study aims to evaluate
   the effect of a tailored multidimensional intervention on the care
   burden among family caregivers of stroke survivors. Based on the
   perceived needs of family caregivers, this intervention takes into
   account scientific recommendations to combine three different
   approaches: skill-building, psychoeducation and peer support.
   Methods and analysis Using a prospective, randomised, open-label,
   parallel-group design, 110 family caregivers will be enrolled from
   Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt between December 2019 and May 2020, and
   randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group.
   The tailored multidimensional intervention will be administered for 6
   months, including three home visits, six home-based telephone calls and
   one peer support session. The primary outcome is the care burden as
   measured using the Zarit Burden Interview. Secondary outcomes include
   changes in the family caregivers' perceived needs (Family Needs
   Questionnaire-Revised), coping strategies (Brief-Coping Orientation to
   Problems Experienced) and quality of life (WHO Quality of Life-BREF).
   Outcomes evaluation will be conducted at baseline (T0), month 3 (T1) and
   month 6 (T2). Independent t-test will be performed to compare the mean
   values of study variables between the two groups at both T1 and T2.
   After adjusting for confounding variables, analysis of covariance will
   be used to assess the effect of the intervention. In addition, repeated
   measures analysis of variance will be conducted to assess changes in
   effect over time.
   Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Research Ethics
   Committee of the Faculty of Nursing, Mansoura University, Mansoura,
   Egypt (P.0195). The results will be published in a scientific
   peer-reviewed journal, and findings will be disseminated at the local
   and international levels.},

Abstract = {Objectives: to understand how the empowerment of family caregivers of
   people with stroke occurs in the hospital environment. Methods: a
   qualitative research, participatory action research, articulated with
   Paulo Freire's Research Itinerary, developed in April 2018 with family
   caregivers, in a Stroke Unit Results: three predominant codes were
   coded: the need for empowerment and autonomy to experience the care
   situation; the challenges experienced in becoming a caregiver; and
   family support Participants presented a lack of information inherent to
   the care process, with distancing from empowerment to perform the
   function in dehospitalization. Dialogue revealed empowerment as a
   possibility for critical awareness and skill development. Conclusions:
   it highlights the importance of directing health promotion for
   caregivers, inserting them in the care process, recognizing their needs
   and intensifying practices that promote empowerment for care, bypassing
   curative actions.},

Abstract = {Introduction: We aimed to evaluate the emotional state and quality of
   life of family caregivers of stroke patients and to investigate the
   relationship between patient factors and these characteristics of
   caregivers.
   Materials and Method: Ninety-seven patients with hemiplegia after a
   cerebrovascular event and their caregivers were included in this
   cross-sectional study. The emotional state of the caregivers was
   evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Their
   quality of life was evaluated with Short Form36. Functional Independence
   Measurement (FIM) and modified-Rankin Score (MRS) were used for
   functional status of the patients, HADS was used for their emotional
   state and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) was used for
   their quality of life.
   Results: Mean HADS-Anxiety score was 9.0 +/- 3.7 and mean
   HADS-Depression score was 8.3 +/- 3.7 in caregivers. Mean HADS-Anxiety
   score was 10.1 +/- 3.4 and mean HADS-D score was 8.7 +/- 3.6 in
   patients. The rates of anxiety disorder and depression in caregivers
   were 39.2\% and 55.7\%, respectively. The rates of anxiety disorder and
   depression in stroke patients were 40.2\% and 50.5\%, respectively. A
   positive correlation was found between HADS scores of caregivers and
   patients (p < 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation
   between the HADS scores of caregivers and SS-QOL scores of patients (p <
   0.05). There was a statistically significant relationship between the
   quality of life of caregivers and the MRS, motor FIM and FIM-total
   scores of patients (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: As a result, mood disorders were common in stroke patients
   and their caregivers. Quality of life of caregivers was decreased. There
   was a relationship between the emotional state of patients and
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {Objective: African Americans are disproportionately affected by stroke
   in the United States (US). The purpose of this study is to explore
   experiences, wants, and needs of African Americans with stroke and their
   family caregivers residing in the stroke belt across the care continuum
   using the `Timing It Right' (TIR) framework as a conceptual guide.
   Design: We conducted a series of focus groups among 20 African Americans
   living with stroke and 19 family caregivers. Focus groups were
   audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. For this secondary analysis, we
   coded qualitative data using the TIR framework. Results: Participants in
   this sample identified pre-stroke needs in addition to the TIR phases
   that span across the care continuum and into community living. We
   identified four important contextual factors and real-world conditions
   that operate in the background and influence the post-stroke needs of
   this specific population across the TIR framework: (1) religion, faith,
   and church, (2) healthcare delivery, (3) community, and (4) sentinel
   events. Conclusions: We propose a TIR model that expands upon the
   original TIR framework which includes factors important for
   consideration when developing and delivering community-based
   interventions among African Americans with stroke and family caregivers
   in the southeastern US.},

Abstract = {Stroke caregivers represent a distinct population and require unique
   considerations when conducting intervention research. Unfortunately,
   there are few published recommendations for conducting intervention
   trials with stroke caregivers. Thus, the goal of this paper is to
   provide foundational guidance for stroke caregiving researchers. We
   describe lessons learned from three trials of the RESCUE intervention to
   illustrate methodological issues in stroke caregiver research. We
   identify challenges encountered while conducting a clinical
   demonstration project, pilot study, and multi-site randomized controlled
   trial of a problem-solving and skills-building stroke caregiver
   intervention. We use our research experiences to exemplify or enhance
   understanding of each issue and describe the strategies we employed to
   overcome these obstacles. We present issues related to and
   recommendations for study design, theoretical frameworks, eligibility
   criteria, recruitment and retention, human subjects protection,
   intervention design, treatment fidelity, outcome measures, and
   qualitative methods. Identifying approaches to circumvent methodological
   challenges can help advance research on and implementation of stroke
   caregiver programs.},

Abstract = {The role of families in providing care for stroke patients at home can
   cause ongoing stress, and can be a burden to caregivers. The purpose of
   this study was to analyze the influence of factors of age, sex,
   education, employment, family relationship, length of care, duration of
   care, health problems of caregiver, and deficit neurology of stroke on
   the burden of caregivers. Study used analytical design through cross
   sectional approach. Samples of 120 caregivers were taken in 2 Puskesmas
   namely Pegirian and Pucang Sewu in Surabaya City with simple random
   sampling technique. Research instruments in the form of questionnaires
   compiled by researchers. Multiple linear regression used to analyze the
   influence of several factors on the burden of caregiver among stroke
   patients. The results of the t-test can be concluded that there is no
   partial effect on age, gender, family relationship, education,
   employment, length of care, health problems of caregivers, and deficit
   neurology of stroke on the burden of caregiver among stroke patients,
   and only the duration of care is influential against the burden of
   caregiver among stroke patients (p value 0.001).},

Title = {Relationship Between General Health and Demographic Characteristics of
   Family Caregivers of Stroke Survivors},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Objectives Caregiving of stroke survivors leads to several
   physiopsychlogical problems for family caregiver due to excessive demand
   by the stroke survivors. The aim of this study was to determine general
   health of the caregivers of stroke survivors and their relationship with
   demographic factors.
   Methods \& Materials This was a cross-sectional study in which 60
   caregivers of stroke survivors were selected by convenience sampling
   from Sina and Firouzgar Hospitals in Tehran province in Iran, in 2015.
   The data was collected by two questionnaires including demographic
   questionnaire and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The collected data
   were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics including mean
   and standard deviation using SPSS software (version 15).
   Results The mean GHQ score was 61.41 +/- 14.9; in female caregiver, it
   was 63.07 +/- 16.09, and in male caregiver, the score was 58.33 +/-
   12.28. Significant correlation found between overall GHQ score and
   either of the factors such as occupational status, age category, or type
   of caring (P=0.01). Unemployment in caregiver, aging, and 24-hour caring
   of stroke survivors were related to a reduction in GHQ score. However,
   there was no significant association between GHQ of stroke caregivers
   and either of the factors such as sex (P=035), time of caring (0.24),
   marital status (P=0.71), or educational status.
   Conclusion This study showed that family caregivers of stroke survivors
   experience deterioration of general health at different dimensions.
   Therefore, it is recommended that planning for general health and social
   support for caregivers should be done through policy making in health
   and treatment.},

Title = {Validation of the Caregiving Knowledge Questionnaire-My: Measuring
   Knowledge Regarding Positioning and Feeding among Malaysian Informal
   Caregivers of Stroke Patients},

Abstract = {Aim: The majority of caregivers for stroke patients in Malaysia are
   informal caregivers, although there are no valid tools to measure their
   knowledge regarding caregiving. Therefore, this study validated the
   Caregiving Knowledge Questionnaire (CKQ-My) as an assessment of
   Malaysian stroke caregivers' knowledge regarding patient positioning and
   feeding. Methods: Back-to-back translation was used to produce a
   bilingual version of the questionnaire. Hand drawings were used to
   replace photographs from the original questionnaire. Face validity and
   content validity were assessed, and construct validity was determined by
   comparing responses from informal caregivers, medical students, and
   primary care doctors. Finally, the internal consistencies of the
   subscales were determined. Results: Pretesting showed that the
   translated version was sufficiently easy to understand. Internal
   consistency for the positioning subscale (28 items, Cronbach's alpha =
   0.70) and feeding subscale (15 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.70) was good.
   Mean scores for the positioning subscale for caregivers (mean: 17.1 +/-
   3.9), medical students (mean: 18.9 +/- 3.1), and doctors (mean 21.5 +/-
   2.2) were significantly different (F = 5.28, P = 0.011). Mean scores for
   the feeding subscale for caregivers (mean 13.1 +/- 2.5), medical
   students (mean 16.1 +/- 1.9), and doctors (mean 16.1 +/- 2.4) also
   differed significantly (F = 6.217, P = 0.006). Conclusions: CKQ-My has
   good internal consistency and construct validity for the subscales
   measuring stroke caregivers' knowledge about positioning and feeding of
   stroke patients. It has potential as an assessment of effectiveness of
   caregiver training and for future studies on long-term stroke outcomes
   in Malaysia.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In this study, it was aimed to assess the prevalence of
   depressive symptoms among patients with stroke and their caregivers and
   to determine factors associated with depression.
   Materials and Method: This study included 97 patients with subacute and
   chronic stroke and 88 caregivers. Patients were evaluated using the
   Brunnstrom motor recovery scale for motor functions, Mini-Mental State
   Examination for cognitive status, Rivermead Mobility Index for mobility
   and Barthel Index for functional status. The patients and their
   caregivers were evaluated for mood disorders using the Beck Depression
   Inventory, and quality of life was evaluated using the Nottingham Health
   Profile.
   Results: Among the participants, 61.9\% of the patients and 52.6\% of
   the caregivers were found to have depressive symptoms. Althought
   comparison of the quality of life scores of the patients and their
   caregivers revealed no significant difference, only the physical aspect
   of quality of life was significantly higher in the patients. Depression
   scores were higher in the patients than in their caregivers. Motor
   functional outcomes of the hand along with mobility, cognitive functions
   and functional status scores were significantly negatively correlated
   with depression scores of the patients. Functional status scores of the
   patients were significantly positively correlated with motor functional
   outcomes (hand and upper/lower extremity), mobility and cognitive
   function scores.
   Conclusion: Functional independence and mobility are the best predictors
   of depressive symptoms in patients with stroke. Assessment and treatment
   of depression in not only in patients but also their caregivers should
   be a part of the general rehabilitation plan since the early stages of
   stroke.},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is one of the most prevalent chronic illnesses
   worldwide. Family caregivers can make a significant contribution toward
   patients' recovery. However, the patient's functional deficits and the
   caregiver's mood states can impact the caregiver's motivation to engage
   in empathic responses toward patients. Clinicians need help in
   recognizing patients at risk for not receiving empathic responses from
   family caregivers who are pivotal in long-term help and emotional
   support. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine possible
   associations of family caregiver perceptions of functional deficits of
   patients who are poststroke and caregiver mood states with their
   empathic responses toward patients who are poststroke. Methodology: As
   guided by Davis' organizational model on empathy, we conducted a
   correlational descriptive study of associations among patient functional
   deficits, caregiver mood states, and caregiver empathic responses toward
   patients who are poststroke. Participants were requested to complete
   four questionnaires. Results: Caregiver fatigue was the only mood state
   significantly associated with their empathic responses toward patients
   who are poststroke. Conclusions: The results of the current study
   contribute to the current state of the literature on poststroke care at
   home by highlighting the impact of caregiver mood states, particularly
   caregiver fatigue, on their empathic responses toward patients who are
   poststroke. Recommendations for clinical practice and future studies
   were made based on this study's results.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship of family caregiver's feeling of
   burden with: the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the patient,
   caregiver's general mood and perceived quality of life. Method:
   Cross-sectional research performed on 32 urban Argentinian caregivers.
   They answered the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), the Beck Depression
   Inventory, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), and the
   World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL.) Results:
   As psychiatric symptoms on the patient increase, a decrease can be
   observed on the quality of life of the family caregiver. As depression
   on the patient deepens, the caregiver experiences a greater burden.
   Discussion: Supplemental information on the need to include the
   assessment of the psycosocial condition of family caregivers of patients
   who had suffered strokes is added with the sole intention of preserving
   their health.},

Abstract = {Today, there is a smartphone app for almost everything. Even though
   ``apps{''} for mobile health (mHealth) seem to be a promising approach
   to address individual needs of patients and caregivers that are affected
   by a chronic medical condition, they are still scarce and their benefits
   have not been studied. Since stroke is the archetype of a chronic
   disease, this paper proposes an mHealth concept for stroke patients and
   their caregivers that combines individual informationwith mobile IT and
   serious games to support the rehabilitation, therapy adherence, and
   secondary stroke prevention. Based on literature and initial expert
   interviews, current shortcomings of German outpatient settings have been
   identified. They are addressed through the mHealth-based Stroke Manager
   App (SMA). Its concept has been evaluated by an online survey and the
   prototype will be evaluated in a field study. In this paper the SMA,
   survey results and the field study's evaluation framework is presented.},

Title = {Stroke Caregiver Depression Qualitative Comparison of Treatment
   Responders and Nonresponders at 1 Year},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Mixed-method studies can shed light on the mechanisms through
   which interventions effectively reduce caregiver depression. OBJECTIVE
   The objective of this qualitative study was to understand factors
   contributing to reduced depressive symptoms in stroke caregiver
   treatment responders compared with nonresponders. METHODS A
   mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used to assess cognitive
   behavioral coping use and helpfulness in reducing depression among
   experimental study treatment responders and nonresponders. Using
   purposive sampling at 1-year of caregiving, we selected responders who
   were not depressed or demonstrated reduction to probable depression and
   nonresponders whose scores indicated worsened or new depression.
   Participants responded to semistructured interviews on life changes and
   the use and helpfulness of intervention coping strategies. Thematic
   analysis identified codes and themes. RESULTS Twelve of 25 participants
   were responders. We identified 2 overarching outcome themes: ``It was
   about me, changing to make life better{''} (responders) and ``Lamenting
   our changed lives{''} (nonresponders). Five subthemes related to coping
   were identified. Whereas responders coped actively and were less
   dependent on the counseling relationship, nonresponders were passive in
   coping and more dependent on the initial counseling relationship. Anger
   or previous psychologic treatment was found in more than a quarter of
   nonresponders and in no responders. Negative life change was found in 9
   of 13 nonresponders compared with 1 responder. CONCLUSION Findings
   support the helpfulness of cognitive behavioral coping. For many
   caregivers, engagement interviews and a more intense, longer
   intervention, such as stepped care and anger management, are indicated
   to mitigate treatment resistance and depressive symptoms, respectively.},

Title = {Benefit finding in first-ever young and middle-aged patients who had a
   stroke and their spousal caregivers in China: a longitudinal

Abstract = {IntroductionThe global burden caused by stroke is shifting to young and
   middle-aged people. Researchers have emphasised the significance of
   benefit finding (BF) in psychological health. However, current research
   has paid little attention to stroke and has discussed BF from only a
   single perspective, that is, that of either patients or caregivers. Our
   study aims to understand the changing trajectory, predictors and dyadic
   interaction of BF in dyads of patient who had a stroke and
   caregiver.Methods and analysisThis study is a longitudinal
   mixed-methods, multicentre study. A total of 142 patients who had a
   stroke and 142 spousal caregivers will be investigated. Participants
   will be recruited from four large public hospitals in northern China.
   Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at five time points
   (near discharge and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months following discharge).
   Validated and reliable questionnaires will be used in quantitative
   studies. Information on sociodemographic data, BF, functional status,
   perceived stress, coping styles and mutuality will be collected from the
   dyads. Qualitative data will be collected via semistructured interviews
   and observations. The growth mixture model will be used to analyse
   quantitative data, and Colaizzi's seven-step analysis method will be
   used to analyse qualitative data. We plan to conduct parallel but
   separate quantitative and qualitative data analyses and ultimately
   integrate the data sets to determine confirmation, expansion or
   discordance.Ethics and disseminationAll participants will be provided
   with an informed consent form. This study will encode all identifiable
   data and store all recorded data on a secure research server. This study
   has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the College of
   Nursing and Health, Zhengzhou University (ZZUIRB2020-53). The results of
   the longitudinal study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and
   presented at national conferences.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the quality of life of stroke survivors and
   their caregivers presenting to a tertiary care setup.Method: The
   descriptive study was conducted from July to December 2019 at the
   Neurology Department, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad,
   Pakistan, and comprised patients of either gender with ischaemic or
   haemorrhagic stroke aged 40-70 years and their caregivers. Data was
   collected using the stroke-specific quality of life Scale and the
   caregiver quality of life questionnaire. Data was analysed using SPSS
   20.Results: Of the 80 patients, 50(62.5\%) were males and 30(37.5\%)
   were females. The overall mean age was 61.46 +/- 11.80 years, and
   56(70\%) were aged >55 years. Among the patients, speaking power,
   mobility and mood were more affected with mean levels of 15.51 +/- 8.63,
   22.63 +/- 8.33 and 19.08 +/- 7.05, respectively. The domains of social
   role, self-care and upper extremity function were also affected with
   mean values of 19.022 +/- 7.06, 15.71 +/- 8.81 and 18.88 +/- 7.02,
   respectively. Among the caregivers, the levels of physical wellbeing and
   functional wellbeing were high 15.07 +/- 5.65 and 15.35 +/- 5.76,
   respectively. There were differences in terms of age and gender but the
   difference was not significant (p>0.05).Conclusion: The quality of life
   of stroke survivors was low, and that of caregivers was also quite
   compromised.},

Title = {The downward referral experiences of stroke caregivers in the regional
   medical alliance in China: A phenomenological study},
Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {101},
Number = {42},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {The downward referral platform in the regional medical alliance has
   provided more possibilities to follow-up rehabilitation and transitional
   care for increasing stroke survivors, which also has the most
   contributions in the rational use of resources and health promotion of
   stroke survivors. However the downward referral rate is low compared to
   upward referral. At present, no scholars have explored the downward
   referral experiences of medical demanders from the perspective of
   qualitative study, and these experiences may also most truly reflect the
   influencing factors of their unwillingness to downward referral.
   Therefore, this study explored the subjective experiences of stroke
   caregivers who had experienced the downward referral, because stroke
   attacks often lead to lack of autonomy of patients themselves, making it
   difficult to complete interviews with them. A descriptive
   phenomenological study was adopted. A purposive sampling strategy was
   used to recruit 13 stroke caregivers. Interviews were guided by a
   semi-structured interview-guide encouraging interviewees to reflect on
   their experiences with downward referral. Coliazzi's data analysis
   process was applied. The analysis of the data revealed 4 themes: coping
   challenges; disrupted information; gaps in medical and nursing
   transition, and potential enabling factors. The results of this study
   showed that the lack of knowledge of medical alliance, non-sharing of
   medical information and non-homogeneousness of medical quality were
   identified to be impeding positive attitude towards downward referral
   and be factors of bad experiences. Of course, the interviewees had
   positive experiences such as smooth referral and comfortable
   environment. These may be potential enabling factors to their attitude
   towards downward referral. The challenges and needs of medical demanders
   after downward referral are worthy of attention, and these should be
   solved by corresponding measures to improve the downward referral rate
   and referral experiences.},

Title = {Associations among disability, depression, anxiety, stress, and quality
   of life between stroke survivors and their family caregivers: An
   Actor-Partner Interdependence Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING},
Abstract = {Aim To explore the effects of disability, depressive, anxiety and stress
   symptoms on patients' and their partners' quality of life (QoL) using
   the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM). Design A cross-sectional
   study using actor-partner interdependence model. Methods We recruited
   183 dyads of stroke survivors and their family caregivers in Indonesia.
   The World Health Organization Disability Assessment (WHODAS 2.0),
   Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-42) and Rand Short Form Health
   Survey (SF-36) were used to measure disability, depressive, anxiety and
   stress symptoms and QoL of stroke survivors and family caregivers. The
   actor-partner interdependence model was tested using multilevel
   modelling. The actor-partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM)
   was applied to estimate the direct and indirect effect. Results
   Disability had actor effects on stroke survivor's overall QoL and
   partner effect on family caregiver's overall QoL. More severe disability
   of stroke survivors was associated with a lower overall QoL of their own
   and that of family caregiver's overall QoL. Depressive symptoms of
   stroke survivors had actor effects on stroke survivors' overall QoL and
   partner effects on family caregivers' overall QoL. Actor and partner
   effects also exist on family caregiver's depression symptoms to their
   own overall QoL and stroke survivor's overall QoL. Moreover, higher
   anxiety symptoms were associated with lower levels of their own and
   partner's overall QoL in both stroke survivors and family caregivers.
   Stroke survivor's stress symptoms also negatively associated with their
   own and family caregiver's overall QoL. However, a family caregiver's
   stress without a partner effects on stroke survivor's overall QoL. The
   APIMeM analysis showed that disability of stroke survivors directly
   decreased their own overall, physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Also,
   disability mediated by stroke survivor's depression, anxiety and stress
   symptoms decreased both stroke survivor's and family caregiver's
   physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Conclusion The findings suggest
   that stroke survivors and family caregivers may influence each other
   during the caregiving process and social life. The disability of stroke
   survivors, and the depression, anxiety and stress symptoms of stroke
   survivors and family caregivers affect their own QoL and their partners'
   QoL. Disability of stroke survivors directly decreased their own
   overall, physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Also, it indirectly via
   stroke survivor's depression, anxiety and stress symptoms decreased both
   stroke survivor's and family caregiver's physical (PCS) and mental QoL
   (MCS). Impact Dyadic actor-partner interdependence models have shown
   promising potential to predict the QoL among patients and family
   caregivers. The dyadic effects of disability, depression, anxiety and
   stress symptoms on the QoL of stroke survivors and family caregivers can
   be applied to guide the future development of nursing intervention
   addressed decreasing depression, anxiety and stress symptoms to optimize
   health outcomes among stroke survivors and their family caregivers.},

Title = {Prevalence of chronic non-specific low back pain among caregivers of
   stroke survivors in Kano, Nigeria and factors associated with it: A
   cross-sectional study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},

Abstract = {PurposeLow back pain (LBP) may have a specific or non-specific cause
   such as abnormal posture or repetitive tasks. For instance, lifting and
   transferring patients during caregiving for stroke survivors may
   predispose the caregivers to LBP. ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to
   determine the prevalence of chronic non-specific LBP and factors
   associated with it in caregivers of stroke survivors. MethodThe research
   design used is cross-sectional study design. Participants of the study
   were caregivers of stroke survivors in Kano, Nigeria who were at least
   18 years old. They were included if they had at least one-month
   experience with caregiving for at least 1 h per day. Presence of LBP and
   level of disability were assessed using participants' self-report and
   Rolland Morris Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire respectively. The
   data collected was analyzed using descriptive, Chi-square statistics and
   Binary Logistics Regression. ResultThree hundred caregivers with mean
   age, 33.24 +/- 10.32 years in which 207 and 93 were males and females
   respectively, participated in the study. The results showed that, there
   was a high prevalence (64.7\%) of LBP among the caregivers. The
   prevalence was significantly associated with gender (p < 0.001), age (p
   = 0.029), occupation (p < 0.001) and duration of caregiving (p < 0.001)
   of the study participants. In addition, the result of the regression
   model showed that, being a female (p = 0.001), a civil servant (p =
   0.031), a trader (p = 0.013), and a complete caregiver (0.001); and
   caregiving for a duration of 5 h or more per day (p = 0.024) are
   significant predictors of having LBP. Similarly, level of disability due
   to the presence of LBP among the study participants was significantly
   associated with gender (p < 0.001), occupation (p < 0.001), duration of
   caregiving (p = 0.025), and the nature of the caregiving (p < 0.001).
   ConclusionInformal caregiving for stroke survivors may result in
   developing chronic non-specific LBP, especially among females, Civil
   servants, traders, complete caregivers and those with long duration of
   caregiving. This can add an additional burden on the family in terms of
   cost of care, result in reduced quality of caregiving and cause
   psychological stress. Thus, it is important the health of the caregivers
   of stroke survivors is considered during stroke rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {Background Strokes may lead to increased dependency, which may impact
   the daily lives of patients with stroke and their family caregivers.
   Caring for a poststroke family member in Indonesia may differ from other
   countries in terms of extending beyond the provision of hands-on care.
   Contradictions and gaps in the factors affecting caregiver depression
   have been highlighted in a review of the relevant literature. Few
   studies have examined comprehensively the contradictory factors,
   uncovered factors, and cultural and spiritual values affecting this
   phenomenon. Purpose This study was designed to identify the factors
   associated with depression in family caregivers of patients with stroke
   in Indonesia. We examined the following factors related to caregiver
   depression: demographic characteristics of the caregiver and care
   recipient, functional ability of the patient, caregiver self-efficacy,
   knowledge regarding stroke care, and spiritual values. Methods In this
   cross-sectional study, 157 primary caregivers completed questionnaires
   involving depression factors during face-to-face interviews. The data
   were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results The prevalence
   of depression among the participants was 56.7\%. The overall mean ages
   of the participants and their care recipients were 43.6 and 57.1 years,
   respectively. In this study, 65.6\% of the participants were female, and
   70.1\% lacked knowledge regarding stroke care. In the early caregiving
   phase, caregiver depression was more likely to occur in female
   caregivers with back pain and long care hours. Self-efficacy in
   achieving respite time was found to be associated with a lower risk of
   depression. Conclusions/Implications for Practice Caregivers' gender,
   presence of back pain, sufficient respite time, and time since stroke
   occurrence should be considered when providing knowledge, skills, and
   coping strategies to caregivers to help them adapt to their caregiving
   role, maintain their quality of life, and prevent the onset of
   depression. Understanding the factors influencing caregiver depression
   may help nursing professionals identify individuals at a higher risk of
   depression early on and provide critical follow-up and early access to
   supportive counseling.},

Abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) has been considered as a prominent
   concept in digital health and is widely used and easily accessible.
   Periodic follow-up visits, previously planned procedures, and
   rehabilitation services for stroke survivors have been cut down during
   the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, in this qualitative study we
   aimed to explore the need for a mobile application in stroke management
   by informal caregivers. Methods: A phenomenological qualitative study
   was conducted from November 2020 to June 2021. Thirteen respondents were
   recruited from two public rehabilitation centers in Kota Bharu,
   Kelantan, Malaysia. In-depth interviews were conducted. A comprehensive
   representation of perspectives from the respondents was achieved through
   purposive sampling. The interviews were conducted in the Kelantanese
   dialect, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using thematic analysis.
   Results: Thirteen participants were involved in the interviews. All of
   them agreed with the need for a mobile application in stroke management.
   They believed the future stroke application will help them to seek
   information, continuous stroke home care, and help in the welfare of
   caregivers and stroke patients. Conclusions: The current study revealed
   two themes with respective subthemes that were identified, namely,
   self-seeking for information and reasons for using a stroke mobile
   application in the future. This application helps in reducing healthcare
   costs, enhancing the rehabilitation process, facilitating patient
   engagement in decision making, and the continuous monitoring of patient
   health.},

Title = {Influence of psychological responses of caregiving on the perceived

Abstract = {Family caregivers provide round-the-clock care to their family members
   who had a stroke. The detrimental effects of caregiving on caregiver's
   health would lead to the abandonment of caregiver role and
   institutionalization of stroke survivors. This study aims to determine
   the factors associated with the perceived health status of family
   caregivers to stroke survivors. This study conducted a secondary
   analysis of the baseline data of 142 family caregivers of stroke
   survivors nested within a longitudinal randomized controlled trial.
   Potential factors were identified according to the Pittsburgh Mind-Body
   Center model and were analyzed with hierarchical multiple regression
   models. The results indicated that stroke caregivers exhibited
   comparable perceived physical health with general population but poorer
   perceived mental health. Severity of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.37,
   P < .001) remained the strongest and most significant factor associated
   with perceived mental health, followed by confidence in problem-solving
   (beta = -0.21, P < .05). Moreover, caregiving competence (beta = 0.29, P
   < .001) was the sole significant psychological factor associated with
   perceived physical health. Caregiving competence, problem-solving
   abilities, and severity of depressive symptoms are significant
   modifiable correlates of the perceived health of caregivers.
   Intervention for improving these psychological responses of caregivers
   is suggested incorporated in stroke rehabilitation programs.},

Abstract = {IntroductionInformal caregivers play a crucial role in supporting the
   activities of daily living, rehabilitation, and the road to recovery for
   stroke survivors. However, these informal caregivers are often reported
   as experiencing neglect and lack of recognition despite their primary
   contribution to stroke recovery. This study investigated the experiences
   of the caregivers of stroke survivors and access to stroke care in
   Malaysia. MethodThis qualitative study with a phenomenological approach
   utilized in-depth interviews, including ten primary caregivers, one
   formal caregiver, and stroke healthcare providers as the participants.
   The interviews were done until the data saturation was achieved, and the
   data was analyzed using thematic analysis. ResultThree primary themes
   and 14 subthemes were identified from the interviews. The role of
   primary caregivers of stroke survivors had tremendous physical, mental
   and social impact on the caregivers. Caregivers had two primary needs.
   The need for information about comprehensive stroke care at home and the
   need for psychological support to themselves. The key internal driver
   for providing care was identified to be the motivation level of the
   stroke survivor and the external driver was identified to be the
   societal support with access to comprehensive stroke care. ConclusionThe
   role of informal caregivers becomes critical for continuum of stroke
   care. As caregivers take up the roles and responsibilities of those who
   contribute to stroke rehabilitation single-handedly soon after hospital
   discharge. Results of this study highlights the needs for providing
   systematic support to caregivers for engaging them in effective stroke
   care, particularly in the community. Stroke service providers, policy
   makers and program planners must be sensitized to empower caregivers of
   stroke survivors in effectively supporting stroke survivor in their
   family on the road of recovery.},

Title = {Relationships between care burden, resilience, and depressive symptoms
   among the main family caregivers of stroke patients: A cross-sectional
   study},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the potential mediating role of
   resilience between care burden and depressive symptoms in family
   caregivers of stroke patients. MethodsA cross-sectional study was
   conducted with a convenience sample involving 245 main family caregivers
   of stroke patients recruited from the neurology department of a Tertiary
   A hospital in China. Mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS
   macro (Model 4) for SPSS, applying the Bootstrap analysis with 5,000
   samples and a 95\% confidence interval. ResultsThe results showed that
   with constant hemiplegia side, Barthel Index, education level, monthly
   income, care time per day, and living with patients in regression
   equations, the resilience partially mediated the correlation of care
   burden and depressive symptoms with a mediation effect ratio of 26.32\%.
   ConclusionsResilience plays a mediating role in the correlation between
   care burden and depressive symptoms. ImpactThe findings indicated a
   protective effect of resilience in alleviating the negative influences
   of care burden on depressive symptoms, suggesting that
   resilience-training intervention may be developed to mitigate depressive
   symptoms of the main family caregivers of stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the burden and quality of life of caregivers of
   stroke survivors with cognitive impairment in selected healthcare
   facilities in Anambra State, Nigeria. Methods: This was a
   cross-sectional survey using the World Health Organization QOL-BREF and
   Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) as instruments. Descriptive statistics of
   frequency, percentage counts, mean and standard deviation were used to
   summarize the socio-demographics. Spearman's ranked order correlation;
   Mann-Whitney U test assessed the correlation and gender and age
   difference in QoL and caregiver's burden. Alpha level was set at 0.05.
   Results: Physical health domain of QOL was slightly moderate (53.29 +/-
   15.19), psychological health was low (46.33 +/- 16.96), social
   relationship was slightly moderate (51.16 +/- 0.31), environmental
   health was slightly moderate (51.22 +/- 15.88), the burden of caregivers
   was high (6.35 +/- 1.29). Conclusion: The quality of life of the
   caregivers of stroke survivors with cognitive impairment was moderate,
   and the caregivers' stress was high in the sample of the population
   studied.},

Title = {Addressing Uncertainty in Informal Familial Caregivers of Stroke
   Survivors: A Systematic Meta-Ethnography},

Abstract = {Background: Informal familial caregivers of stroke survivors experience
   uncertainty that begins at the time of the stroke event and continues
   into home-based care. The uncertainty faced by caregivers contributes to
   poor mental and physical health outcomes. Objective: This review details
   the factors associated with, impacts of, and coping skills used to
   manage uncertainty across the caregiving trajectory. By defining
   uncertainty reduction and tolerance recommendations, this review also
   builds upon the Stroke Caregiver Readiness Model to improve preparedness
   following the stroke event. Methods: A meta-ethnographic review was
   systematically conducted on thirteen qualitative studies with 218
   participants from four countries. The Critical Appraisal Skills
   Programme (CASP) was used to assess study quality. Results: Following
   the stroke event, caregivers reported a lack of knowing (e.g., about the
   cause of the stroke event and survivor prognoses) as contributing to
   post-stroke uncertainty. As a result of this uncertainty, caregivers
   expressed concerns about their abilities to navigate caregiving
   responsibilities and how to plan for the future. Longer-term concerns
   (e.g., managing finances) and feelings of hopelessness occurred after
   discharge. Still, caregivers identified strategies to manage
   uncertainty. Caregiver coping skills included present-focused thinking,
   gratitude, faith, humor, and social support. Conclusions: The
   uncertainty faced by informal familial caregivers of stroke survivors is
   pervasive and changes across time. Uncertainty reduction and tolerance
   interventions can be used to build upon caregiver strengths and promote
   preparedness across the caregiving trajectory.},

Journal = {CLINICAL NURSING RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences and needs of
   family caregivers of stroke patients who require physical restraints.
   The themes and sub-themes that emerged included ``the reason for the use
   of PR{''} (disruptive behaviors of the patient and personal reasons of
   caregivers), ``the turmoil of having to use PR{''} (inevitableness,
   comparing benefits and harms, the emotional effect of PR, and physical
   effects), and ``unmet needs and suggestions{''} (unmeet needs and
   suggestions). Nurses should take the experiences of patient relatives
   into account in the process of PR application, organize training
   programs, and determine application standards for PR.},

Title = {Disagreement about perceptions of patient disability between the stroke
   patient and caregiver: a cross sectional study exploring the association
   to patient and caregiver quality of life},
Journal = {AGING \& MENTAL HEALTH},
Abstract = {Objectives This study explored the association of disagreement in the
   perception of patient disability between patients and family caregivers
   with physical and psychological quality of life (QOL) in both parties.
   Methods A cross-sectional analysis of data collected from male stroke
   patients and family caregivers was conducted. Physical and psychological
   QOL in patients and caregivers were measured using the WHOQOL BREF.
   Perceptions of patient disability were measured using the 12-item WHO
   Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (DAS). Using DAS scores reported
   independently by patients and caregivers, dyads were categorized into
   one of four groups representing agreement or disagreement about patient
   disability. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the
   associations between WHOQOL scores in patients and caregivers and these
   four groups. Results Among 56 dyads enrolled, approximately 52\% were
   categorized into `agreement' groups and 48\% were categorized into
   `disagreement' groups. The disagreement in perception about patient
   disability were significantly associated with poor patient physical QOL.
   However, the disagreement in perception were not significantly
   associated with caregiver QOL. Conclusion Findings suggest the
   association of disagreement with QOL differs between patients and
   caregivers. Further research is needed to carefully appraise the
   relationship and interaction between patient and caregiver.},

Title = {Coaching-Based Teleoccupational Guidance for Home-Based Stroke Survivors
   and Their Family Caregivers: Study Protocol for a Superior Randomized
   Controlled Trial},
Journal = {EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background. Home-based rehabilitation has been shown to be useful for
   stroke survivors to participate in daily life activities and return to
   their families. However, many home-based stroke survivors face
   challenges in the lack of professional guidance, rational training
   plans, and insufficient motivation, which will affect their
   rehabilitation outcomes to varying degrees. Though occupational therapy
   and coaching are widely recommended for stroke rehabilitation, studies
   that combine these two interventions via telerehabilitation in
   home-based rehabilitation are limited. Hence, this study will explore
   whether coaching-based teleoccupational guidance (CTG) will help stroke
   survivors and caregivers obtain satisfactory outcomes. Methods. This
   single-blind (assessor), two-arm parallel superior randomised controlled
   trial will be conducted in the Hebei General Hospital, Shijiazhuang,
   China. Ninety-two participant dyads in home-based rehabilitation will be
   recruited and randomised to either CTG (intervention group) or a
   standard telerehabilitation group (control group). Participant dyads in
   the intervention group will follow a 6-step circle procedure and receive
   12 teleoccupational coaching sessions over 3 months via WeChat. Data
   will be collected at baseline, after the intervention (3 months), and
   follow-up (6 months). The Reintegration to Normal Living Index will be
   the primary outcome to assess the participation of stroke survivors.
   Secondary outcomes will not only involve an observation of changes in
   activities of daily living, intrinsic motivation, motor function, and
   quality of life of stroke survivors but also will focus on the
   caregivers' perceived benefit and care burden. Discussion. This trial
   will assess the effects of CTG compared with standard
   telerehabilitation. We believe that the results of this study will add
   to the understanding of occupational therapy for stroke survivors in
   home-based rehabilitation and provide a reference for developing health
   policy and facilitating other chronic management.},

Abstract = {Aim To synthesize and present the currently available literature on the
   experiences of spousal and adult child caregivers of stroke patients in
   transitional care. Design This is a qualitative systematic review. Data
   Sources Eight electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase,
   Web of Science, PsychINFO, ProQuest and Scopus) were searched from
   September 2020 to April 2022 for relevant literature and grey
   literature. Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of sspousal or
   adult child caregivers of stroke survivors up till 1 year after
   discharge were included. Review Methods The selection of articles was
   done by two independent reviewers who screened the titles and the
   abstracts of studies, and the full texts of selected articles. Quality
   appraisal and data extraction of selected articles were undertaken by
   two independent reviewers using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical
   appraisal tools. Data synthesis was conducted using a meta-aggregative
   approach recommended by JBI. Results A total of 19 papers were included
   in this review. A total of three synthesized findings centred around
   caregivers' experience with healthcare professionals, changes in their
   life roles and needs, effects of caregiving and how they adapted to
   their changes were aggregated. Conclusion Spousal and adult child
   caregivers faced multiple barriers during transitional care, such as the
   lack of resources and an inability to cope with changes in their lives.
   Support and adequate preparation were key facilitators in easing stroke
   caregivers into their role. Impact The findings from this review can be
   used to guide future implementations of caregiver education programmes
   and comprehensive discharge planning for stroke survivors.},

Title = {The RESCUE Problem Solving Intervention for Stroke Caregivers: A
   Mixed-Methods Pilot Study},

Abstract = {Purpose/Objective: Stroke caregivers face many challenges after a family
   member experiences stroke. Because caregivers play such a crucial role
   in health care, there is a need for more interventions in web-based
   formats that focus on caregiver psycho-education and skills building. A
   pilot study was devised to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
   value of an active, 4-week telephone and web-based intervention for
   stroke caregivers. Method/Design: A one-group, pretest-posttest design
   with a mixed-methods approach was used. Qualitative data supplemented
   the quantitative findings. Community-dwelling caregivers of stroke
   patients were recruited from the Veterans Health Administration.
   Quantitative data were collected pre and postintervention.
   Semistructured interviews were completed with a subsample of caregivers
   to capture more detail about the acceptability and value of the
   intervention. Results: Ninety-three caregivers were recruited; 72
   caregivers completed the intervention and 21 withdrew (77\% completion
   rate). From pre- to posttest, caregiver depression (p = .008) and
   caregiver burden (p = .013) decreased. Problem-solving abilities and
   health-related quality of life showed no change. Seventy-eight percent
   of caregivers rated the intervention sessions with the nurses as very
   helpful or extremely helpful, and 76\% reported using the
   problem-solving strategies a moderate amount to extremely often.
   Interviews suggest that the intervention was valuable and led to new
   strategies to relieve stress and prioritize health.
   Conclusions/Implications: The intervention was feasible to implement and
   acceptable to caregivers. This intervention shows promise for fulfilling
   a need for more web-based interventions that focus on skills building
   and psycho-education, but more rigorous testing is needed to determine
   effectiveness.
   Impact and Implications There is a shortage of active, tailored
   interventions for family stroke caregivers that focus on skills building
   and psychoeducation that can also be delivered in telehealth formats and
   accommodate caregivers' busy lives. An intervention was developed to
   meet these needs, with the goal of reducing caregiver depressive
   symptoms and caregiver burden. Theoretically grounded in stress and
   coping theory and using a systematic approach to problem-solving, we
   offer a brief yet comprehensive intervention to reduce stroke caregiver
   burden and depression. This was a pilot study. Qualitative and
   quantitative data were compared side-by-side to reveal the intervention
   process and outcomes. Pre/post outcomes on depression, burden, quality
   of life, and problem-solving skills were collected to assess the
   feasibility of the intervention. The lessons learned from this effort
   are relevant to other brief web-based interventions that involve active
   participation between nurses and caregivers. Although more rigorous
   testing is needed to confirm outcomes, the intervention has the
   potential to empower stroke caregivers, help them identify and solve
   common caregiving problems, and address the mental health strain of
   caregiving. The intervention could be a model for clinician-caregiver
   partnerships. Nurses and caregivers discussed, developed, and
   strategized in-home care support for stroke survivors, without the need
   to visit a hospital or clinic.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke family caregivers were already struggling with unmet
   needs and changes in their own lives from providing care. The COVID-19
   pandemic added further stress and disruption to their lives. The purpose
   of this study was to describe life changes in 17 stroke family
   caregivers specifically resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS:
   This study was conducted as a secondary data analysis from an ongoing
   randomized controlled clinical trial testing feasibility of the
   Telehealth Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK III). Using a
   multimethod design, both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed
   to determine caregiver life changes. Quantitative ratings regarding life
   changes were obtained using 17 items adapted specifically for COVID-19
   from the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale. Rigorous content analysis
   procedures for the qualitative data were guided by a start list of codes
   based on the 17 items, with additional themes possible. Representative
   quotes were selected based on author consensus. RESULTS: Findings
   revealed both negative and positive life changes from the COVID-19
   pandemic. Negative life changes included such things as disrupted daily
   routines, limited access to healthcare providers and resources (eg,
   food, masks, hand sanitizers), reduced family and social contact and
   activities, decreased emotional well-being, and problems with performing
   caregiving activities for the survivor. Positive life changes were
   increased use of the Internet and videoconferencing, closer
   relationships with friends, and learning how to access needed resources
   in new ways. CONCLUSION: Stroke family caregivers experienced both
   negative and positive life changes specifically as a result of the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Responses further indicated that COVID-19 affected
   most caregivers in different ways and an individualized approach is
   needed in dealing with caregiver life changes.},

Title = {Impact of Stroke Survivors' Physical Disability on the Presence of
   Caregiver Burden: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE NURSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {146-150},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Caregiver burden associated with caring for stroke survivors
   remains a prominent issue in nursing. With stroke being a leading cause
   of disability worldwide, it is essential that the impact of the stroke
   survivor's physical disability be analyzed so interventions can be
   developed to relieve related caregiver burden. The purpose of this
   systematic review is to review the existing nursing and allied-health
   literature aimed at the impact of stroke survivors' physical disability
   on the presence of caregiver burden. METHODS: A systematic review of the
   CINAHL (R) and PubMed databases was conducted using Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines (searched on
   June 16, 2021). Study inclusion criteria for this review were as
   follows: (1) publication in the last 5 years, (2) examined the impact of
   stroke survivors' physical disability on caregiver burden, (3)
   caregiver-survivor dyads 18 years or older, (4) published in English,
   and (5) longitudinal study designs (an exception for reports that
   present findings not demonstrated in longitudinal studies). Data
   extracted from articles included sample characteristics, study design,
   instruments, analyses, and results. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies met
   the inclusion criteria and were synthesized for use in this systematic
   review. These studies implemented a variety of instruments to assess for
   both physical disability in the stroke patient and caregiver burden. A
   positive correlation between physical disability and caregiver burden
   was universally reported. CONCLUSION: Further nursing research is
   warranted to explore the aspects of physical disability that contribute
   to caregiver burden and to develop interventions to improve the physical
   functioning of stroke survivors, include social determinants of health,
   and specifically address the greatest contributors to caregiver burden.},

Title = {The moderating role of caregiver preparedness on the relationship
   between depression and stroke-specific quality of life in stroke dyads:
   a longitudinal study},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING},
Abstract = {Aims To examine the moderating role of caregiver preparedness on the
   association between stroke survivors' depression and stroke-specific
   quality of life dimensions. Methods and results We used a multilevel
   modelling approach to analyse trajectories of change in the eight Stroke
   Impact Scale 3.0 subscales {[}i.e. strength, communication, mobility,
   activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living
   (IADL), memory, emotion, hand function, participation] using
   Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Caregiver preparedness significantly
   moderated the association between survivor depressive symptoms and
   survivor communication (B = -0.95, P < 0.01), mobility (B = -0.60, P <
   0.05), and ADL/IADL (B = -0.73, P < 0.01) at baseline; linear change for
   strength (B = 0.83, P < 0.05) and communication (B = 0.66, P < 0.05);
   and quadratic change for strength (B = -0.19, P < 0.01). Although
   caregiver preparedness did not significantly moderate the association
   between survivor depressive symptoms and strength at baseline, there was
   a significant moderating effect for change over time. Higher levels of
   caregiver preparedness were significantly associated with higher
   survivor scores of emotion, hand function, and participation at
   baseline. Conclusions Including immediate caregivers in the care
   process, through a psycho-educational training, would mean having
   better-prepared caregivers and consequently more-healthy stroke
   survivors. Given that preparedness includes coping with stress,
   responding and managing emergencies, assessing help and information may
   require tailored interventions aimed at improving the caregivers' skills
   and knowledge about stroke survivors' management.},

Title = {A Descriptive Qualitative Study of Foreign Caregivers of Older Adult
   Stroke Survivors},
Journal = {GERONTOLOGIST},
Abstract = {Background and Objectives With a growing aging stroke population and the
   changing structure of the society, the demand for foreign caregivers has
   rapidly increased in Taiwan and many other developed countries. However,
   little is known regarding the perception, values, and abilities of
   foreign caregivers and how those may influence their quality of care.
   This study aimed to explore and describe the experiences of Indonesian
   foreign caregivers, the largest migrant working population in Taiwan,
   who reside with and provide support to older adults with stroke and
   their families. Research Design and Methods By adopting a descriptive
   qualitative approach, we conducted semistructured interviews with 22
   Indonesian caregivers (mean age: 36 years) who were providing care to
   community-dwelling older stroke survivors (age >= 65 years) in Taiwan.
   Data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Results Six themes were
   constructed from the interviews: (a) foreign caregiver's background, (b)
   foreign caregiver's perception of the health and functional status of
   stroke survivors, (c) foreign caregiver's values and preferences, (d)
   consequences of caring for stroke survivors, (e)
   skills/abilities/knowledge of foreign caregivers to provide stroke
   survivors with required care, and (f) potential resources that foreign
   caregivers can use. Discussion and Implications Foreign caregivers
   described the positive and negative aspects of caring for stroke
   survivors. Differences in language, religion, culture, values, and
   expectations between foreign caregivers and stroke survivors influence
   the caregiving experience. These findings can help Taiwan and other
   developed countries to better support foreign caregivers providing
   critical care to older adults with stroke and their families.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among experts (using the
   Delphi technique) to validate the informative content that should be
   included in an App to be used by informal caregivers of stroke patients
   in order to improve their quality of life, facilitating access to the
   health care system and involving them in their own health. This
   technique was developed between June and December 2021. The group of
   experts was selected on the basis of previously established criteria,
   and the coefficient of variation (v) was used as a measure of consensus.
   In addition, the concordance index was calculated to determine the
   stability of the different rounds. In the first round, the preliminary
   content, previously elaborated by the research group, was evaluated as
   very appropriate for the objectives set (N-P < 1.07). In addition,
   averages of 4.5 out of five and a coefficient of variation of less than
   0.5 were obtained, confirming the consensus. In the second round,
   suggestions were made by the experts on how to improve the content of
   the information, obtaining 100\% agreement with the results obtained in
   the first round. The results obtained allow a positive evaluation of the
   use of the Delphi method for the elaboration of the information to be
   housed in an App.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is a major cause of burden which can lead to
   anxiety and depressive disorders in stroke patients and their
   caregivers. This study aimed to assess the burden of depression and
   anxiety and covariates as well as its association with functional
   disability level among stroke survivors and caregivers dyads. Methods:
   This cross-sectional study assessed for anxiety and depressive symptoms,
   and perceived burden among survivors of stroke and their caregivers in
   the rehabilitation center of Kinshasa; using the Hospital Anxiety and
   Depression Scale to identify participants with anxiety and depression;
   the Zarit Burden Inventory to assess the burden of depression and
   anxiety; and the modified Rankin scale used to assess functional outcome
   or level of disability. Results: Eight in ten caregivers of stroke
   survivors perceived the burden, which took more expression of depression
   than anxiety, whereas three in ten stroke survivors had a burden
   expressed by symptoms consistent with depressive and anxiety disorders.
   Being married increases the risk of perceiving the burden among stroke
   survivors. We found a positive association between high level of burden
   and depression and anxiety among caretakers of stroke survivors.
   Moreover, our findings did not reveal a statistical association between
   the burden and level of dependence evaluated based on the severity of
   disability. Conclusions: The psychological burden is higher among
   caregivers than stroke survivors. Specialized programs targeted the
   psychological distress, its association with anxiety and depressive
   symptoms; and the functional disability level of stroke survivors should
   be integrated into the rehabilitation center of patients with disabled
   illnesses. Our findings warrant further studies to test the impact of
   reducing psychological burden on functional disability.},

Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Stroke impacts care dependency, and thus the patient needs home care
   after suffering a stroke. This study was carried out to investigate
   similarities and differences between the assessments made by family
   caregivers and nurses regarding the care dependency level of stroke
   patients in Indonesian hospitals. This study was a comparative study of
   the care dependency of stroke patients. Data were collected on the
   stroke wards on the day of admission using the Care Dependency Scale
   (CDS). The sample consisted of 118 family caregivers and 21 nurses. The
   Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to determine the mean
   differences between the paired data collected by family caregivers and
   nurses. The results of this study show that significant differences
   exist between the family caregivers' and nurses' assessments regarding
   the care dependency levels of stroke patients. Nurses assigned higher
   scores to all CDS items than family caregivers did. Significant
   differences between the family caregivers' and nurses' assessments were
   observed on numerous items of the Care Dependency Scale. This study
   contributes to efforts to raise awareness of potential differences in
   perceived care dependency levels of stroke patients. The findings can
   help nurses plan the patient's discharge together with family
   caregivers.},

   the study was to determine the feasibility (usability, satisfaction, and
   potential effectiveness on psychological well-being) of an online
   mindfulness intervention for stroke survivors and caregivers. Using
   mixed methods, 11 stroke survivors and three caregivers participated in
   a 3-week, online, Langerian mindfulness intervention. A semi-structured
   interview assessed the intervention's usability and gathered feedback.
   Self-reported measures about psychological well-being were documented
   remotely 3 times (preintervention, postintervention, and 1-month
   follow-up). Qualitatively, participants were highly satisfied with the
   intervention and reported subjective benefits, but the usability of the
   online platform was poor. None of the self-reported measures changed
   over time. This study provided evidence of feasibility of an online
   Langerian mindfulness intervention in a new population: stroke survivors
   and caregivers.},

Abstract = {Aims and objectives To explore the shared experiences of people with
   stroke and caregivers in preparedness to manage post-discharge care.
   Background People with stroke and caregivers show dyadic effects in
   dealing with post-discharge care challenges. However, few studies have
   explored their shared experiences and unique challenges for each dyadic
   member in preparedness to manage post-discharge care. This study
   addresses this research gap. Design An interpretive approach underpinned
   by Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics. Methods Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with people with stroke and caregivers in 5
   days before hospital discharge (n = 26) or 2 weeks after discharge (n =
   4) between July and December 2019. The study followed a five-step data
   analysis method aligning with Gadamerian hermeneutics. The study
   reporting followed the COREQ checklist. Results Three themes and six
   subthemes were identified. First, both people with stroke and caregivers
   experienced psychological stress, although the sources differed. Second,
   stroke dyads demonstrated resilience built on positive thoughts,
   confidence, and support from family and health professionals. Third,
   stroke dyads exhibited different levels of certainty about
   post-discharge care. They desired to be equal partners in co-developing
   and co-implementing discharge plans. Conclusions Similarities and
   differences in perceived preparedness to manage post-discharge care
   existed between stroke dyadic members. A co-design approach to
   developing and implementing discharge plans would enhance planned
   post-discharge care. Impact Hospital-to-home transition is a challenging
   time for people with stroke and their caregivers. Understanding the
   shared experiences of stroke dyads in preparedness for post-discharge
   care enables nurses to take proactive actions to enhance managing
   post-discharge care. Early identification of those at risk of developing
   psychological stress will enable nurses to co-develop stress-coping
   strategies. These will have a positive influence on the dyad when facing
   setbacks due to stroke-related complications.},

Abstract = {Aims This review aims to examine updated evidence to evaluate the
   effectiveness of caregiver-mediated exercise interventions on basic and
   extended activities of daily living (ADL), anxiety and depression of
   post-stroke rehabilitation individuals. Design A systematic review and
   meta-analysis. Data sources Six electronic databases, including CINAHL,
   CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus, grey literature and trial
   registry were searched from inception until February 2021. Methods Only
   randomized controlled trials written in English were included.
   Meta-analyses were conducted for basic and extended ADL, anxiety and
   depression outcomes using RevMan software. Overall quality of evidence
   was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development
   and Evaluation framework. Results A total of 11 randomized controlled
   trials comprising 2120 participants were identified, with 10 trials
   meta-analysed. Meta-analyses indicated statistically significant effects
   favouring caregiver-mediated exercise interventions for basic ADL.
   Subgroup analyses revealed significant effects for exercise-only
   interventions mediated by caregivers for basic ADL. No significant
   effects were found for extended ADL, anxiety and depression for stroke
   survivors. Conclusion Caregiver-mediated exercise interventions appear
   to have beneficial impacts on basic ADL for stroke survivors, suggesting
   caregiver-mediated exercise interventions as a potentially feasible way
   to improve functional independence. Impact Caregiver-mediated
   intervention with exercises as a major component could be a promising
   approach to augment stroke rehabilitation. Future research should
   include high-quality studies with focus on specific intervention
   components or to explore caregiver outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background: Caregivers of stroke survivors need trusted information on
   stroke prevention, rehabilitation, and self-care.
   Purpose: Develop and evaluate the English and Spanish-language RESCUE
   stroke caregiver websites and conduct a promotional campaign to enhance
   their reach.
   Methods: We developed websites by partnering with organizations and
   using health communication guidelines for consumer-oriented,
   age-appropriate, and culturally sensitive materials. Healthcare provider
   focus groups and caregiver interviews were conducted to obtain feedback.
   Websites were refined and assessed for usability through ``think
   aloud{''} testing and surveys. We implemented a multi-faceted
   promotional campaign and measured website visits.
   Results: Providers (N = 32) and caregivers (N = 47) responded positively
   to the websites, describing them as comprehensive and appropriate.
   Usability testing indicated the websites were appealing, informative,
   and organized. Caregivers with minimal computer skills had difficulty
   navigating the websites. The websites received 218,529 visits over 2
   years. Promotional activities corresponded with increases in website
   visits.
   Discussion: Involving end-users and collaborating with partners enhances
   the accessibility and relevance of online health resources.
   Multi-faceted promotional efforts and key stakeholder partnerships are
   required to enhance and sustain the reach of online caregiving
   resources.
   Translation to Health Education Practice: The RESCUE websites are
   comprehensive public sources of evidence-based materials to support
   stroke patients and their caregivers.},

Title = {Factors Explaining Quality of Life among Family Caregivers of People
   with Stroke in Myanmar: A Cross-sectional Study},

Abstract = {Advanced health care systems have led to increased survival among people
   with stroke; however, the disability level remains high. Caring for the
   people with stroke and consequent disabling conditions places an undue
   strain on their caregivers, which may, in turn, reduce their quality of
   life, subsequently affecting the quality of care. Thus, understanding
   the factors explaining the quality of life is needed to design
   interventions to improve the quality of life among caregivers. This
   correlational study was conducted among 303 family caregivers of people
   with stroke three months after being discharged from hospital to home
   from three general hospitals in Myanmar. Six validated instruments were
   used to collect caregiver data: a demographic questionnaire, the Barthel
   Index, the Zarit Burden Interview, The Brief COPE, the Multidimensional
   Scale of Perceived Social Support and the World Health Organization
   Quality of Life -Brief (WHOQOL-BREF). Data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analysis.
   Results indicated that educational and occupational status of
   caregivers, average family income per month, numbers of caregiving hours
   per day, functional status of people with stroke, the burden of
   caregivers, and perceived social support were significantly accounted
   for 84\% of the variance to the quality of life, which is very high. The
   burden was the most significant factor in explaining the quality of
   life, followed by education and perceived social support. Nurses need to
   apply innovative technology to provide continuous care at home,
   especially in the first three months, to reduce caregivers' burden.
   Also, the Myanmar government needs to strengthen health insurance
   systems to reduce the financial burden, which significantly affects the
   quality of life of the caregivers.},

Title = {Factors impacting the access and use of formal health and social
   services by caregivers of stroke survivors: an interpretive description
   study},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Background Evidence has shown that family and friend caregivers of
   stroke survivors are significantly and negatively impacted by
   caregiving. The negative effects of caregiving may persist over time
   suggesting that caregivers might benefit from ongoing engagement with
   supportive services. However, little is known about caregivers' use of
   formally funded health and social services, or the factors influencing
   their access to and use of these services. The aim of this study is to
   increase understanding of the factors that influence stroke caregivers'
   access and use of formal health and social services, from the
   perspective of stroke caregivers and healthcare providers. Methods A
   qualitative study was conducted with stroke caregivers and health
   providers in Ontario, Canada using interpretive description. In-depth
   interviews were conducted with caregivers of survivors who experienced a
   stroke between six months to five years previous and healthcare
   providers who support caregivers and stroke survivors. All participants
   provided written informed consent. Interview data were analyzed using
   constant comparison to identify codes and develop key thematic
   constructs. Results A total of 40 interviews were conducted with 22
   stroke caregivers at an average 30-months post-stroke and 18 health
   providers. Factors that influenced stroke caregivers' access and use of
   services included: finances and transportation; challenges caregivers
   faced in caring for their health; trust that they could leave their
   family member and trust in health providers; limited information
   pertaining to services and a lack of suitable services; and the response
   of their social networks to their caregiving situation. Conclusion
   Stroke caregivers experience significant challenges in accessing and
   using formal health and social services. These challenges could be
   addressed by increasing availability of subsidized community-based
   supports such as respite and counselling tailored to meet the ongoing
   needs of caregivers. Systemic change is needed by the health system that
   readily includes and supports caregivers throughout the stroke recovery
   continuum, particularly in the community setting.},

Journal = {NURSING RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},

Abstract = {Aim. To gain more knowledge of caregiver strain in the Life After Stroke
   Trial (LAST) population. Methods. This is a substudy of the LAST study,
   including all caregivers' reports of perceived Caregiver Strain Index
   (CSI) at inclusion and 18-month follow-up irrespective of group
   allocation. The checklist ``STROBE Statement-Checklist of items that
   should be included in reports of cohort studies{''} was used. Caregivers
   to adults (age >= 18 years), here defined as the person living with, a
   patient with a first-ever or recurrent stroke, community dwelling, with
   modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <5 and no serious comorbidities, was invited
   to fill out the Caregiver Strain Index at three months (10-16 weeks)
   poststroke. Domains indicating differences of change in perceived strain
   in the total sample were analyzed in a linear regression analysis.
   Results. Caregiver strain (n = 147) varying from 5\% to 27\% was
   reported by the caregivers at baseline and between 2\% to18\% at
   18-month follow-up. The items indicating the highest level of strain at
   baseline and 18 months were as follows: ``Care giving is confining,{''}
   ``There have been changes in personal plans,{''} ``There have been
   emotional adjustments,{''} and ``I feel completely overwhelmed.{''} The
   samples were divided into age groups 0-79 years and 80-100 years,
   indicating a higher strain on the caregiver for persons 80-100 years at
   18 months. Conclusion. Caregiver strain was relatively low both at
   baseline and at 18-month follow-up. Main caregiver strains were reported
   in terms of a sense of confinement, a tendency of emotional strain, and
   the altering of plans at both time points. Depression was one of the
   main explanatory factors for the perceived caregiver strain. The
   perception of caregiver strain was higher in age groups 80-100 years
   than age groups 0-79 years.},

Title = {Experiences of family caregivers 3-months after stroke: results of the
   prospective trans-regional network for stroke intervention with
   telemedicine registry (TRANSIT-Stroke)},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},

Abstract = {Background: Long-term support of stroke patients living at home is often
   delivered by family caregivers (FC). We identified characteristics of
   stroke patients being associated with receiving care by a FC 3-months (3
   M) after stroke, assessed positive and negative experiences and
   individual burden of FC caring for stroke patients and determined
   factors associated with caregiving experiences and burden of FC 3 M
   after stroke.
   Methods: Data were collected within TRANSIT-Stroke, a regional
   telemedical stroke-network comprising 12 hospitals in Germany. Patients
   with stroke/TIA providing informed consent were followed up 3 M after
   the index event. The postal patient-questionnaire was accompanied by an
   anonymous questionnaire for FC comprising information on positive and
   negative experiences of FC as well as on burden of caregiving
   operationalized by the Caregiver Reaction Assessment and a self-rated
   burden-scale, respectively. Multivariable logistic and linear regression
   analyses were performed.
   Results: Between 01/2016 and 06/2019, 3532 patients provided baseline
   and 3 M-follow-up- data and 1044 FC responded to questionnaires
   regarding positive and negative caregiving experiences and caregiving
   burden. 74.4\% of FC were older than 55 years, 70.1\% were women and
   67.5\% were spouses. Older age, diabetes and lower Barthel-Index in
   patients were significantly associated with a higher probability of
   receiving care by a FC at 3 M. Positive experiences of FC comprised the
   importance (81.5\%) and the privilege (70.0\%) of caring for their
   relative; negative experiences of FC included financial difficulties
   associated with caregiving (20.4\%). Median overall self-rated burden
   was 30 (IQR: 0-50; range 0-100). Older age of stroke patients was
   associated with a lower caregiver burden, whereas younger age of FC led
   to higher burden. More than half of the stroke patients in whom a FC
   questionnaire was completed did self-report that they are not being
   cared by a FC. This stroke patient group tended to be younger, more
   often male with less severe stroke and less comorbidities who lived more
   often with a partner.
   Conclusions: The majority of caregivers wanted to care for their
   relatives but experienced burden at the same time. Elderly patients,
   patients with a lower Barthel Index at discharge and diabetes are at
   higher risk of needing care by a family caregiver.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING},
Abstract = {Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to explore the moderated
   mediation mechanism of the relationships among family function,
   self-efficacy, care hours per day, closeness and benefit finding in
   family caregivers of patients with stroke in China. Background Benefit
   finding can provide a new means of resolving depression among family
   members caring for an ill loved one. However, current research has paid
   little attention to the benefit finding of family caregivers of stroke
   patients in China. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods Three hundred
   fifty family caregivers of patients with stroke were recruited from
   community service centres and hospitals in Zhengzhou, China. The
   participants completed the family APGAR index, caregiver benefit finding
   scale and Chinese general self-efficacy scale during a study conducted
   in 2017. Descriptive analyses and a moderated mediation model were
   computed. Reporting adhered to the STROBE checklist. Results A total of
   311 family caregivers completed this study. Closeness between family
   caregivers and patients with stroke moderated the relationship between
   family function and caregiver benefit finding. Self-efficacy partially
   mediated the relationship between family function and caregiver benefit
   finding; moreover, care hours per day moderated the mediation.
   Conclusion This study shows important factors associated with benefit
   finding in family caregivers of patients with stroke. This indicates
   elements that could help improve benefit finding intervention programmes
   for family caregivers of patients with stroke. Relevance to clinical
   practice The findings in our study provide valuable information on
   benefit finding and indicate some interventions to improve the mental
   health of family caregivers of stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Background \& Objectives: This study was carried out to evaluate the
   effects of discharge training on quality of life and self-efficacy in
   stroke patients and their informal caregivers; and reintegration to
   normal living in patients only. Methods: In this randomized, controlled
   trial, 59 patients and their caregivers were randomly allocated to
   receive discharge with education (via a webpage or booklet) or a
   standard of care discharge without intervention (i.e. an additional
   training). The 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the General
   Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) were applied to patients and caregivers and
   the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI) were applied to patients
   only, before discharge and 3 months after discharge. Results: It was
   found that, although the quality of life improved by the trainings in
   the patient intervention groups, compared with the control group
   (p<0.05); there was no change in self-efficacy parameter (p>0.05). Both
   self-efficacy and quality of life of the caregivers improved or
   maintained by the interventions, compared with the controls (p<0.05). In
   general, there was no significant difference between training methods
   (webpage versus booklet) (p>0.05). Lastly, the impact of discharge
   trainings on reintegration to normal living which was assessed in the
   patients only, was found to be limited. Conclusion: Although discharge
   training improved the quality of life in both patients and informal
   caregivers, its effect on self-efficacy in both populations and
   reintegration to normal living in patients was found to be limited.},

Title = {The preparedness assessment for the transition home after stroke
   predicts key domains of caregiver health},
Journal = {TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION},
Abstract = {Background: Caregivers of stroke survivors often experience adverse
   health effects due to poor preparation.
   Objectives: We evaluate the concurrent and predictive validity of the
   Preparedness Assessment for the Transition Home after Stroke (PATH-s)
   family caregiver assessment tool relative to important domains of
   caregiver health and stroke survivor outcomes.
   Methods: A convenience sample of caregivers (N = 183) was assessed on
   several health-related quality of life instruments prior to stroke
   survivor discharge (T1), and at 30-days (T2) and 90-days (T3)
   post-discharge.
   Results: Caregivers completed assessments at T1 (N = 183), T2 (N = 116,
   63\%), and T3 (N = 97, 53\%). At T1, the PATH-s demonstrated concurrent
   validity with depressive symptoms (r = -0.26, p < .001), global health
   (r = 0.45 p < .001) and activation (r = 0.34, p < .001). The PATH-s also
   has predicted improvements in T2 outcomes including depressive symptoms
   (r(adj) = -0.21, p < .05), global health (r(adj) = 0.30, p < .01),
   perceived stress (r(adj) = -0.30, p < .01), activation (r(adj) = 0.21, p
   < .05), caregiving-specific health-related quality of life (r = 0.23, p
   < .05), and caregiver strain (r = -0.36, p < .001). At T3, higher scores
   on the PATH-s were a significant predictor for improvements in
   activation (r(adj) = 0.24, p < .05).
   Conclusion: The PATH-s demonstrates good concurrent and predictive
   validity and predicts important domains relevant to caregiver
   well-being. This can be used to identify gaps in caregiver preparedness
   so interventions can be tailored to optimize the transition home and
   mitigate adverse effects of caregiving.},

Abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored multidimensional
   intervention in reducing the care burden of family caregivers of stroke
   survivors. This intervention considered caregivers' perceived needs and
   incorporated three evidence-based dimensions (psychoeducation,
   skill-building and peer support).
   Design A prospective randomised control trial.
   Setting A community-based study conducted in Egypt.
   Participants A total of 110 caregivers aged >= 18 years who cared for a
   survivor within 6 months of stroke, with modified Rankin Scale scores of
   3-5, and without other physical disabilities or terminal illnesses were
   recruited between December 2019 and May 2020. Participants were assigned
   to the intervention group (IC; n=55) and control group (CG; n=55)
   through open-label, parallel 1:1 randomisation.
   Intervention The IG was provided with tailored multidimensional
   interventions for 6 months until November 2020, including three home
   visits, six home-based telephone calls and one peer-support session. The
   CG received simple educational instructions at a single visit.
   Outcome The participants completed the Zarit Burden Interview (primary
   outcome) and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (secondary outcome) before the
   intervention (TO), at 3 months (T1) and at 6 months (T2).
   Results No differences were observed between the characteristics of the
   groups at baseline (T0). The independent t-test showed no significant
   differences in the care burden and Quality of Life (QoL) at T1 and T2
   between the groups. The intervention had no significant effect on the
   outcomes between or within groups over time, as shown by the
   repeated-measures analysis of variance. However, the group and time
   interaction had significant main effects on caregivers' QoL
   (psychological and social domains).
   Conclusion The main results showed that participants in the IG did not
   experience an improvement in the main outcomes. Nevertheless, the
   improvement in the psychological and social domains may have been
   attributed to our intervention.},

Abstract = {Background
   Caregivers often use the internet to access information related to
   stroke care to improve preparedness, thereby reducing uncertainty and
   enhancing the quality of care.
   Method
   Social media communities used by caregivers of people affected by stroke
   were identified using popular keywords searched for using Google.
   Communities were filtered based on their ability to provide support to
   caregivers. Data from the included communities were extracted and
   analysed to determine the content and level of interaction.
   Results
   There was a significant rise in the use of social media by caregivers of
   people affected by stroke. The most popular social media communities
   were charitable and governmental organizations with the highest user
   interaction-this was for topics related to stroke prevention, signs and
   symptoms, and caregiver self-care delivered through video-based
   resources.
   Conclusion
   Findings show the ability of social media to support stroke caregiver
   needs and practices that should be considered to increase their
   interaction and support.},

Title = {Understanding the interplay between lifestyle factors and emotional
   distress for hemorrhagic stroke survivors and their informal caregivers:
   Protocol for a mixed methods dyadic natural history study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and PTS) and unhealthy
   lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet,
   limited physical activity, medication adherence) are common in
   hemorrhagic stroke (HS) survivors and may increase risk for recurrence,
   morbidity, and mortality. Emotional distress and unhealthy lifestyle
   factors tend to be interdependent between survivors and their informal
   caregivers (e.g., family and friends who provide unpaid care; together
   called dyads), such that one partner's lifestyle and coping behaviors
   influence the other's behaviors, yet no research has closely examined
   this relationship in HS dyads over time. We will conduct a mixed methods
   study to quantitatively and qualitatively understand the longitudinal
   relationship between emotional distress and lifestyle factors across
   time in this population (HS dyads) to identify treatment targets to
   prevent emotional distress chronicity and stroke recurrence. In aim 1,
   we will assess emotional distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTS)
   and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, limited
   physical activity medication adherence/blood pressure control) in dyads
   of survivors of HS and their caregivers (N = 80), at three separate time
   points (hospitalization in the Neuro-ICU, 1, and 3 months later). We
   hypothesize that 1) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be
   interrelated within and across time for both survivors and caregivers,
   and 2) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be interdependent
   between survivors and caregivers. We also aim to explore the nuanced
   interplay between lifestyle factors and emotional distress and gain in
   depth information on barriers and facilitators for a dyadic intervention
   to optimize lifestyle behaviors and emotional functioning in HS dyads.
   Eligible patients will be adults who have a caregiver also willing to
   participate. Patients will be referred for study participation by the
   nursing team who will ensure that they are cognitively able to
   meaningfully participate. Multilevel dyadic modeling (i.e.,
   actor-partner interdependence model; APIM) with distinguishable dyads
   will be used to determine influences of these factors onto each other
   over time. In Aim 2, we will conduct live video qualitative dyadic
   interviews (N = 20 or until theme saturation) at all time points from
   the same participants with and without emotional distress and at least
   one lifestyle risk factor, to understand the nuanced relationships
   between emotional distress and lifestyle behaviors, and barriers and
   facilitators to engagement in a skills-based psychosocial intervention.
   Interviews will be analyzed using inductive and deductive approaches.
   The present study is currently ongoing. So far, we enrolled 2
   participants. Recruitment will end October 2022 with plans to analyze
   data by December 2022. The findings from this study will be used to
   further develop psychosocial interventions and inform novel treatments
   for survivors of HS and their informal caregivers.},

Title = {Caregiver strain and fatigue are independent determinants of anxiety
   among patients early after stroke},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION},
Abstract = {Anxiety and depression are common mental health disorders in stroke
   patients, and often co-occur. However, in contrast to depression, there
   is limited research about anxiety after stroke, although impact of
   anxiety can be substantial. Therefore, this cross-sectional
   observational study investigated determinants of anxiety after stroke
   and compared them with determinants of depression after stroke. Stroke
   surviving patients (n = 284) were seen six weeks after discharge from
   the hospital or rehabilitation setting. Of these, 238 patients answered
   all questions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale measuring
   anxiety (HADS-a) and 239 patients answered all questions measuring
   depression (HADS-d). Step-wise regression was used to identify
   independent determinants of anxiety and depression after stroke. Higher
   levels of anxiety were associated with a higher caregiver strain (p <
   0.01) and more fatigue (p < 0.05). In contrast, higher levels of
   depression were associated with lower life satisfaction (p < 0.001) and
   less daily activities (p < 0.05), but also more fatigue (p < 0.001).
   Hence, our results show that both fatigue and caregiver strain are
   associated with higher levels of anxiety, but of these only fatigue is
   also associated with higher levels of depression. Practitioners should
   therefore ask for both anxiety and depression symptoms in stroke
   patients.},

Abstract = {Chronic diseases show a significant limitation on the quality of life
   and functional status, as patients as also their caregivers. The
   objective of this study is to analyse the quality of life of patients
   diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke and
   their caregivers, and to find out if there is a relationship between the
   caregiver's overload and the quality of life of the patient, as well as
   to determine whether the functional status of the patients is related to
   the quality of life of the caregiver. Quantitative, observational,
   descriptive, cross-sectional and prospective study, performed at Primary
   Health Care Centres of the northwest Area of Murcia Region (Spain),
   between January and May 2018, with 131 patients, 79 with stroke, 48 with
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4 of them with both diseases),
   and 110 caregivers. The EuroQol scale, Zarit's questionnaire and
   Barthel's index and an ad hoc questionnaire of sociodemographic
   variables developed for this study were used. We found a positive and
   significant correlation between the scores of the caregiver's overload
   scale and those of the caregiver's health status (r = -0.425; p =
   0.001), and a negative and also significant correlation between the
   overload and quality of life of the patients (r = -0.297; p = 0.002) and
   their inability (r = 0.189; p = 0.048). The more the overload we find
   the worse quality of life of the caregiver, but better quality of life
   of the patient. The physical inability of the patients also influences
   on the caregiver's level of overload, but not in his health status.
   Intervention programmes are needed to improve the quality of life of
   family members as they are the best patient support and the best help
   for healthcare professionals.},

Title = {Family Caregivers' Experiences and Coping Strategies in Managing Stroke
   Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration Study},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke is a chronic disease that requires stroke survivors
   to be supported long-term by their families. This is especially because
   of the inaccessibility to post-stroke rehabilitation outside hospitals.
   The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis and the pandemic
   restrictions in Malaysia are expected to exponentially increase the
   demand from family caregivers in supporting stroke survivors. Thus, this
   study aims to explore the burden, experience, and coping mechanism of
   the family caregivers supporting stroke survivors during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Methodology: A phenomenological qualitative study was
   conducted from November 2020 to June 2021 in Malaysia. A total of 13
   respondents were recruited from two public rehabilitation centers in
   Kota Bharu, Kelantan. In-depth interviews were conducted with the
   participants. Comprehensive representation of perspectives from the
   respondents was achieved through purposive sampling. The interviews were
   conducted in the Kelantanese dialect, recorded, transcribed, and
   analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes on burdens and
   experiences were identified. They were worsening pre-existing issues,
   emerging new issues, and fewer burdens and challenges. Two themes on
   coping strategies were also identified. They were problem-focused
   engagement and emotion-focused engagement. Conclusions: The COVID-19
   pandemic has changed the entire system of stroke management. While
   family caregivers mostly faced the extra burden through different
   experiences, they also encountered some positive impacts from the
   pandemic. The integrated healthcare system, especially in the era of
   digitalization, is an important element to establish the collaborative
   commitment of multiple stakeholders to compensate burden and sustain the
   healthcare of stroke survivors during the pandemic.},

Title = {Development and Psychometric Properties of the Caregiver Burden Scale in
   Polish Caregivers of Stroke Patients},

Pages = {665-675},
Abstract = {Purpose: Most stroke patients require long-term care of their family
   members. Excessive care burden entails several negative consequences;
   therefore, the severity of the burden should be periodically assessed.
   For this purpose, valid multidimensional measures are needed. Our study,
   which is a part of a larger research project, aims to translate and
   evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish Caregiver Burden
   Scale (CBS) in relation to construct validity and internal consistency
   in caregivers of the patients after stroke.
   Patients and Methods: The sample of this cross-sectional observational
   study consisted of 366 informal caregivers to consecutive first-ever
   stroke survivors. The five-factor Polish CBS and the Hospital Anxiety
   and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered during the home visits at
   three to six months after patients' hospitalisation. Exploratory (EFA),
   confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses and a net analysis were performed to
   investigate the internal structure and a factorial construct validity of
   the CBS. Correlation analyses between the CBS and the HADS were carried
   out to examine convergent validity. Cronbach's alpha and item-total
   correlation were applied to assess internal consistency.
   Results: Three out of five factors identified by EFA were similar to the
   original indices of the CBS, while the remaining two deviated from the
   original structure of the CBS. The CFA five-factor model represented an
   acceptable fit (confirmatory fit index, CFI = 0.96, root mean square
   error, RMSEA = 0.04) but only after a modification. All subscale scores
   of the CBS were positively correlated with the HADS, supporting the
   convergent validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the overall scale
   (0.92) and all subscales (0.72-0.87) except one (0.69) and item-total
   correlation results indicated good internal consistency.
   Conclusion: The Polish version of the CBS showed acceptable internal
   consistency and good convergent validity. Factorial validity and
   structural integrity were partially supported. The interrelationships
   between the CBS subdomains, their partial mutual contamination, and the
   scale's non-orthogonal structure should be considered when interpreting
   the results of further studies using this version of the scale.},

Abstract = {Purpose The specific aims of this scoping review of the literature are
   to (1) map the current scope of literature regarding nonpharmacological
   interventions for informal stroke caregivers and (2) explore the degree
   to which racial/ethnic minority groups were represented in
   nonpharmacological interventions for stroke caregivers in the United
   States. Design and Methods Arksey and O'Malley's methodological
   framework was used to conduct this scoping review. The framework entails
   formulating research questions, developing criteria for selecting
   relevant studies, charting the data, and synthesizing results. Findings
   The scoping review yielded 11 studies that varied in intervention
   design, methods of implementation, and outcome measurements. The review
   indicated that racial and ethnic minorities were less likely to be
   represented in nonpharmacological intervention studies for stroke
   caregivers. Conclusion Currently, there is sparse research that focuses
   on interventions with family caregivers of varying racial/ethnic groups
   in the United States.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the qualitative descriptive first phase of a
   participatory action research study, which aimed to develop a stroke
   prevention model for people at risk of stroke in a tertiary hospital.
   The study's purpose was to explore caregivers' perceptions of
   preventative behaviors for family members at risk of stroke. The
   qualitative data collection was conducted through semi-structured
   interviews held with 36 primary caregivers living for at least one year
   with family members at risk of stroke risk people. All informants were
   recruited through purposive sampling. The interviews were recorded,
   transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis.
   The five emergent categories from the analysis were 1) struggle to
   modify behaviors, 2) lack of adequate knowledge about stroke prevention,
   3) lack of awareness as being caregivers, 4) constraints of being
   caregivers, and 5) receiving unrealistic treatment regimens. These
   findings contribute to the need for interventions that enhance awareness
   and competency of the family caregiver, as well as promote the
   participation and collaboration of care among family caregivers and
   their family members, in addition, redesigning a stroke prevention
   service which appropriate with individual context.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study is to explore the experience of
   stroke patients and caregivers after discharge from the hospital.
   Method: A range of databases were searched, including Pubmed, Wiley, and
   Proquest as well as grey literature, reference lists, and Google
   Scholar. The review included qualitative primary peer-reviewed research
   studies that focused on exploring the patients' and caregivers'
   experience in caring for stroke patients after returning from a
   hospital.
   Result: Stroke patients and their caregivers experience several problems
   after discharge from the hospital. Of the seven articles, three themes
   were obtained, namely health information, support from health workers
   and role changes.
   Conclusion: This review shows that many stroke patients and their
   caregivers are not prepared well for the patients' activities at home.
   Improving knowledge and skills for caregivers is essential to help them
   take care of the patients at home. (C) 2021 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All

Abstract = {Objective: This research aims to identify the educational contents for
   the caregiver of post-stroke patients that will be delivered in video
   media.
   Methods: The Delphi technique underwent three rounds to reach an
   agreement. Seven experts participated in all rounds. The first round was
   begun by giving open-questions to the experts. The second round
   collected and evaluated the answers of the first round to be returned to
   the experts for the validity assessment using a Likert-scale.
   Furthermore, the third round was the result of the second round, which
   was re-evaluated and justified as an agreement.
   Results: The results of the first round of the Delphi technique are 17
   topics. The second round produces 11 topics and proceeds to the third
   round. The third round generates 12 topics.
   Conclusion: The expert panel concluded 12 topics to be the content for
   video-based education. (C) 2021 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to evaluate caregiver burden among
   caregivers of acute stroke patients with a biopsychosocial perspective
   in a Turkey sample.
   Methods: 72 stroke patients and 72 their caregivers were included the
   study. The mean age of the stroke patients included in the study was 65
   +/- 12.39. The mean age of caregivers was 44.5 +/- 14 and 66.7\% of them
   were females. Modified Motor Assessment Scale (MMAS), Standardized Mini
   Mental State Examination (SMMSE) and The Barthel Index (BI) were used to
   assess the patients with stroke. The caregivers were evaluated by using
   the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale, Family Sense of Coherence
   Scale-Short Form (FSOC-S), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
   WHOQOL-Bref-Short Form and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
   Support (MSPSS).
   Results: There were significant positive correlation between the BCOS
   score and the SMMSE (r=0.36; p=0.002) and BI (r=0.22; p=0.05) scores. A
   significant positive correlation was found between the BCOS score and
   MSPSS's family (r=0.31; p=0.007), friend (r=0.41; p<0.01) and special
   human (r=0.46; p<0.01) sub-parameters. In addition, there were
   significant positive correlations between BCOS score and the physical
   (r=0.35; p=0.02) and environmental (r=0.42; p<0.01) sub-dimensions of
   the WHOQOL-BREF, also HADS Depression sub-score (r=0.93; p=0.01).
   Correlations between BCOS score and patients' age, MMAS, FSOC-S, scores
   and HAD Anxiety sub-score were not statistically significant (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: The cognitive function and independence level of the
   patients is associated with care burden. Furthermore, psychosocial
   features such as poor social functioning, quality of life and emotional
   health of caregiver have adverse effects on caregiver burden.},

Title = {Self-care interventions in stroke survivor-caregiver dyads: a protocol
   for systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Abstract = {Introduction Stroke is known as one of the leading causes of mortality
   and disability worldwide. Self-care plays a significant role in
   improving the quality of life, self-efficacy and many other outcomes of
   stroke survivors. However, it is a dyadic phenomenon where patient
   self-care and the caregiver contribution to self-care are inter-related
   in terms of predictors and outcomes. Currently, there is still no
   systematic assessment conducted to examine the overall effectiveness of
   self-care interventions carried out in stroke survivor-caregiver dyads
   and explore the effect on stroke survivor and/or caregiver outcomes.
   Methods We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the
   evidence regarding the self-care interventions carried out in stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyads. We will undertake a systematic search of
   multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO,
   EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and four Chinese
   databases (CNKI, CBM, WANFANG and VIP) from inception to July 2021 for
   the purpose of collecting the relevant articles. The eligible studies
   are defined as those original researches, written in English or Chinese,
   on self-care interventions in stroke survivor-caregiver dyad samples.
   Two independent researchers will be deployed to identify the eligible
   trials according to the selection criteria and extract the relevant
   data. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and
   Meta-Analysis Protocols checklist has been used for this protocol. We
   will use the Cochrane Risk for Bias tool to assess the risk of bias for
   randomised controlled trials. Ethics and dissemination In our review,
   any identifiable patient data will be excluded, which removes the need
   for ethical approval and participant consent. The final results of our
   study will be published in an open-access peer-reviewed journal, and
   abstract will be presented at suitable national/international
   conferences. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021239824.},

Abstract = {This study reports on outcomes for 169 caregivers enrolled in the
   Michigan Stroke Transitions Trial (MISTT), an RCT of social work case
   management for stroke patients returning home. A mixed-model approach
   examined the mean change from 7- to 90-days post-discharge with
   group-by-time interactions for differences between treatment groups.
   Caregivers reported few life changes or depressive symptoms from
   caregiving. There was no significant change over time or treatment
   effects. Negative aspects of stroke caregiving may take longer to
   develop. Focused caregiver assessment at discharge and a better
   understanding of how caregiving develops over time may improve the type
   and timing of support.},

Title = {Preparedness for caregiving moderates the association between burden and
   health-related quality of life among family caregivers of stroke
   patients in Nigeria},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY},
Abstract = {Studies on improving the health-related quality of life of stroke
   patients are abundant, but less attention has been given to the factors
   influencing the wellbeing of their family caregivers, especially in low-
   to middle-income countries such as Nigeria where the burden of stroke is
   expected to increase. In this study, we examined the moderating role of
   preparedness for caregiving in the connection between the burden of
   caregiving and health-related quality of life of family caregivers of
   stroke patients in Nigeria. Family caregivers of stroke patients (140
   females and 60 males; aged between 18 and 57 years) were purposively
   sampled from a Federal Medical Center in Southeastern Nigeria.
   Participants completed measures of caregiver's strain (burden),
   health-related quality of life, and preparedness to give care. Results
   showed that burden negatively predicted physical health (beta = -.61,
   CI: {[}-.89, -.34]) and mental health (beta = -.76, CI: {[}-1.07, -.45])
   dimensions of the health-related quality of life, respectively. Results
   also showed that preparedness moderated the relationship between burden
   and physical health (beta = .21, CI: {[}.11, .32]), as well as mental
   health (beta = .24, CI: {[}.12, .35]) dimensions. Ensuring that
   caregivers of stroke patients are adequately prepared to give care could
   ameliorate the negative impacts of caregiving on health of family
   caregivers of stroke patients.},

Title = {Caregiver Depression Among Home-Bound Stroke Patients in an Urban
   Community},
Journal = {CUREUS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Introduction
   The sudden undertaking of being a caregiver for a spouse or family
   member afflicted with a stroke can cause adverse psychological
   consequences. In Malaysia, the majority of stroke patients return home
   to be cared for by family members and continue rehabilitation as
   outpatients. In most local urban communities, the practice of shared
   caregiving is observed among stroke caregivers either out of necessity
   or familism. Sole or primary caregivers who share their homes with
   stroke patients would be more challenged physically and psychologically
   compared to secondary or joint caregivers. Sharing the caregiving
   responsibilities is believed to lighten the burden on primary
   caregivers. This study aims to determine the proportion and associated
   factors of depression among urban-dwelling caregivers of home-bound
   stroke patients receiving long-term care from a university-based primary
   care clinic.
   Methodology
   A cross-sectional study involving 123 primary and secondary caregivers
   of stroke patients was conducted at Klinik Primer PPUKM Cheras (KPPC)
   and the outpatient Medical Rehabilitation Services Department Hospital
   Canselor Tuanku Muhriz (HCTM), Cheras Kuala Lumpur. A self-administered
   questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic characteristics, the Beck
   Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Multidimensional Scale of
   Perceived Social Support questionnaire (MSPSS) was used. The functional
   status of the stroke patients was assessed using the Modified Rankin
   Score (MRS).
   Results
   The proportion of respondents with depression was 20.3\% (n=25).
   Depression was associated with caregivers' age (CI=42.23-50.09,
   p=0.016), presence of illness (p=0.001), and being a sole caregiver
   (p=0.001). There is also an association found between caregiver
   depression with longer duration post-stroke (CI= 12.75-16.13, p<0.001),
   longer time spent for caregiving (CI= 117.73-135.87, p=0.004), and more
   functionally dependant patients (p=0.002).
   Conclusion
   Depression affects one in five caregivers of home-bound stroke patients
   residing in the urban community. The primary care provider should be
   more vigilant in screening for depression, especially among caregivers
   who are from older age groups, have ongoing health problems, and are
   sole caregivers to patients who are functionally dependant.},

Abstract = {Although the overall incidence of stroke in the United States has
   decreased in recent years, the incidence of stroke among Black Americans
   has not changed. This has resulted in a widening gap between White and
   Black stroke survivors and their families. A variety of factors
   contribute to this inequity including social determinants of health
   (e.g., adverse life events, discrimination, neighborhood deprivation,
   lack of access to health care). This article uses a ``case and frame{''}
   approach, through the lens of ecological systems theory, to illustrate
   how social determinants of health express themselves in two stroke
   survivor-caregiver dyads living in a large Midwestern city. We draw out
   implications for practice and policy in social work and related
   disciplines that focus on recognizing the impact of social determinants
   of health, developing culturally-specific interventions that mitigate
   unique stressors but that also leverage unique strengths, and building
   capacity for cultural competence and cross-cultural health communication
   within organizations.},

Abstract = {Telemedicine implementation in ambulances can reduce time to treatment
   for stroke patients, which is important as ``time is brain{''} for these
   patients. Limited research has explored the demands placed on acute
   stroke caregivers in a telemedicine-integrated ambulance system. This
   study investigates the impact of telemedicine on workload, teamwork,
   workflow, and communication of geographically distributed caregivers
   delivering stroke care in ambulance-based telemedicine and usability of
   the system. Simulated stroke sessions were conducted with 27 caregivers,
   who subsequently completed a survey measuring workload, usability, and
   teamwork. Follow-up interviews with each caregiver ascertained how
   telemedicine affected workflow and demands which were analyzed for
   barriers and facilitators to using telemedicine. Caregivers experienced
   moderate workload and rated team effectiveness and usability high.
   Barriers included frustration with equipment and with the training of
   caregivers increasing demands, the loss of personal connection of the
   neurologists with the patients, and physical constraints in the
   ambulance. Facilitators were more common with live visual communication
   increasing teamwork and efficiency, the ease of access to neurologist,
   increased flexibility, and high overall satisfaction and usability.
   Future research should focus on eliminating these barriers and
   supporting the distributed cognition of caregivers.},

Abstract = {Purpose To understand the user expectations and the facilitators and
   barriers of using a virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic
   ({''}virtual clinic{''}). Methods A qualitative descriptive study
   involving two rounds of face-to-face semi-structured interviews per
   participant was conducted. We purposively recruited ten participants in
   Hong Kong who were receiving traditional stroke rehabilitation. The
   first interview was conducted to explore participants' expectations. The
   second interview was conducted after a 4-week trial of the virtual
   clinic. Both interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The
   findings were translated from Cantonese into English. Results Before
   using the virtual clinic, the participants perceived a need for (i)
   information communication technology guidance and support, (ii) familiar
   hardware and applications, and (iii) services to meet psychosocial
   needs. Facilitators identified by the participants included (i) feeling
   safe and supported, (ii) willingness to learn, adapt to, and use the new
   service, and (iii) ease of use with a flexible schedule. Issues relating
   to (i) internet connectivity, (ii) hardware, and (iii) interface and
   design were perceived barriers to the use of the clinic. Conclusion This
   study provides findings of users' expectations of using telehealth
   services. Their perspectives on facilitators and barriers may increase
   the adoption of the newly developed telehealth service.},

Abstract = {According to Lazarus and Folkman's theory, stress and coping affect an
   individual's anxiety, which is an adaptive outcome. This study examined
   the mediation effects of stress-coping strategies on the relationship
   between stress and anxiety in caregivers of patients with acute stroke.
   A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to analyze a total of 131
   caregivers caring for patients with acute stroke at a university
   hospital. The Caregivers Stress Scale, Ways of Coping Questionnaire, and
   Korean Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to quantify the participants'
   responses. Our results revealed that emotion-focused coping (beta = .56,
   p < .001) partially mediated the relationship between stress and anxiety
   (Z = 3.30, p < .001), suggesting its ability to exacerbate anxiety in
   the short term by acting as a mediator between stress and anxiety.
   Developing appropriate coping strategies for caregivers of patients with
   acute stroke is therefore critical for reducing their anxiety.},

Abstract = {AIM: This is a study protocol designed to evaluate the effect of
   transitional care model based interventions for patients with stroke and
   their caregivers on the caregivers' perceived competency, their
   preparedness for caregiving, increasing their electronic health
   literacy, reducing burnout, the rate of patients' hospital readmissions,
   and the frequency of pressure injuries.
   METHOD: The study protocol was planned as a randomized controlled trial
   with parallel arms. The study will include 70 patients with stroke and
   their caregivers. Multiple interventions (TEMpEST-Transitional Care
   Model Stroke Turkey), including at least 3 face-to-face interviews at
   the hospital, distance education via web, and telephone communications
   for 3 months, and 1 home visit within 7 days of discharge will be
   applied to the study group. The control arm will receive routine care.
   RESULTS: Findings will give after then when completed the study
   protocol.
   CONCLUSION: This study will evaluate the feasibility of interventions
   TEMpEST and its effect on patients with stroke and their caregivers.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a Two-Tier Family-Oriented Intervention in Enhancing
   the Family Functioning and Care Capacity of the Family Caregivers of
   Stroke Survivors: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},

Abstract = {Background: Stroke has profound impacts on families. Often, family
   members, including stroke survivors and the person who takes up the role
   of the primary caregiver, would encounter demands on finances,
   rehabilitation arrangement, and even conflicts. Hence, a family-oriented
   intervention is expected to enable families to rebuild internal and
   external resources to achieve optimal rehabilitation and community
   reintegration.
   Objective: This study aims to describe a design of a two-tier
   family-oriented care management intervention for enhancing the family
   functioning and care capacity of the caregivers of stroke survivors.
   Methods: The two-tier care management intervention was guided by a
   standardized protocol conducted by trained professional care managers
   (first tier) with the support of trained volunteers (second tier), which
   lasted for 8-12 weeks. Participants were recruited through collaborating
   hospitals according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. In order to
   examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two-tier care
   management intervention, a two-arm randomization multicenter study was
   designed, including an active comparison group, which was guided by a
   standardized protocol conducted by trained volunteers. Dyadic
   participants, including both stroke survivors and their primary
   caregivers for both groups, were invited to participate in a
   questionnaire survey using standardized and purposefully developed
   measures 3 times: before the intervention, immediately after the
   intervention, and 2 months after the intervention. The primary outcome
   was family functioning measured by the Family Role Performance Scale and
   Family Assessment Device-General Functioning Scale. The secondary
   outcomes included caregiving burden, depressive symptoms, care
   management strategies, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
   Results: Recruitment began in January 2017 and was completed at the end
   of April 2019. Data collection was completed at the end of March 2020.
   As of March 2020, enrollment has been completed (n=264 stroke
   caregivers). A total of 200 participants completed the baseline
   questionnaires We aim to publish the results by mid-2021.
   Conclusions: This study successfully developed a two-tier care
   management protocol that aims to enhance the family functioning of the
   caregivers of stroke survivors. Guided by a standardized protocol, this
   family-oriented two-tier intervention protocol was found to be feasible
   among Chinese families.},

Title = {Role of caregiver factors in outpatient medical follow-up post-stroke:
   observational study in Singapore},
Journal = {BMC FAMILY PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {Background Outpatient medical follow-up post-stroke is not only crucial
   for secondary prevention but is also associated with a reduced risk of
   rehospitalization. However, being voluntary and non-urgent, it is
   potentially determined by both healthcare needs and the
   socio-demographic context of stroke survivor-caregiver dyads. Therefore,
   we aimed to examine the role of caregiver factors in outpatient medical
   follow-up (primary care (PC) and specialist outpatient care (SOC))
   post-stroke. Method Stroke survivors and caregivers from the Singapore
   Stroke Study, a prospective, yearlong, observational study, contributed
   to the study sample. Participants were interviewed 3-monthly for data
   collection. Counts of PC and SOC visits were extracted from the National
   Claims Database. Poisson modelling was used to explore the association
   of caregiver (and patient) factors with PC/SOC visits over 0-3 months
   (early) and 4-12 months (late) post-stroke. Results For the current
   analysis, 256 stroke survivors and caregivers were included. While
   caregiver-reported memory problems of a stroke survivor (IRR: 0.954;
   95\% CI: 0.919, 0.990) and caregiver burden (IRR: 0.976; 95\% CI: 0.959,
   0.993) were significantly associated with lower early post-stroke PC
   visits, co-residing caregiver (IRR: 1.576; 95\% CI: 1.040, 2.389) and
   negative care management strategies (IRR: 1.033; 95\% CI: 1.005, 1.061)
   were significantly associated with higher late post-stroke SOC visits.
   Conclusion We demonstrated that the association of caregiver factors
   with outpatient medical follow-up varied by the type of service (i.e.,
   PC versus SOC) and temporally. Our results support family-centred care
   provision by family physicians viewing caregivers not only as
   facilitators of care in the community but also as active members of the
   care team and as clients requiring care and regular assessments.},

Abstract = {This scoping review mapped out the relevant literature, identified gaps
   and made suggestions on the subject of the health needs of family
   caregivers (FC) of elderly stroke survivors (ESS). The authors utilised
   the PRISMA-ScR checklist to guide the scoping review. The databases
   PubMed, Elsevier and BioMed Central were searched for academic articles
   published in the English Language between the years 2010 and 2020 that
   met a pre-set criteria of content on the health needs of FC of ESS. The
   process of selection of sources of evidence based on screening and
   eligibility of evidence reduced the initially identified 13,303 sources
   of evidence in the searched databases to five sources of evidence. The
   content of these five sources of evidence was mapped out on a charting
   table where data was summarised and synthesised first individually and
   then collectively by the authors. Repetitive and irrelevant data were
   removed collectively by the authors from the charting table. The gaps
   identified were a paucity of research on the subject of health needs of
   FC of ESS, lack of longitudinal and mixed-methods research on the health
   needs of FC of ESS, sparse use of social sciences perspectives and
   theories, research that addresses specific physical and mental health
   concerns beyond general descriptions and gaps in information, social
   networks, interventions, health policy and systems. Future research
   directions were suggested and a limitation of this scoping review are
   addressed in the discussion.},

Abstract = {Background: The purpose of the present study was to examine the internal
   consistency reliability and construct validity of the Caregiving Burden
   Instrument in Korean informal caregivers of stroke survivors. Methods: A
   descriptive survey design was used with a convenience sample of 208
   primary caregivers of stroke survivors. Internal consistency reliability
   was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Construct validity was
   assessed using exploratory and known-group analysis. Results: Each
   subscale and the total scale demonstrated satisfactory internal
   consistency reliability. Exploratory factor analysis identified five
   factors: family support, patient's dependency, physical health,
   financial burden, and psychological health, which together accounted for
   62.7\% of the variance. Known-group analysis indicated that caregivers
   with more than one year of experience reported significantly higher mean
   scores for the total burden score and its five subscales compared to
   those with less than one year. Conclusions: This 23-item instrument
   demonstrates good internal consistency reliability and construct
   validity. The tool can be used to effectively assess burden in
   caregivers of stroke survivors and the data obtained can form the basis
   for the development of family interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: The study's main goal has been to investigate the social
   representations of stroke patients' family caregivers by focusing on
   self-care. Methods: It is a descriptive study, which used the
   theoretical approach of social representations. There were investigated
   20 caregivers who attended two specialized clinics in Belem city, Para
   State, Brazil. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews
   and processed by the inductive thematic analysis technique. Results:
   Self-care was represented by caregivers as difficult to combine to their
   activities of caring for the person suffering from stroke due to work
   overload, which generated stress and frustration. Some caregivers were
   able to transform this stress into a representation belonging to a
   complexity of their experience and the care reality. Conclusion: It was
   possible to access their social imagery and, consequently, the
   production of linked meanings as caregivers' actions, behaviors and
   cognitive components involved in the care reality.},

Journal = {REVISTA LATINO-AMERICANA DE ENFERMAGEM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Objective: to analyze the effectiveness of a support intervention on the
   burden and stress of family caregivers and on the stroke survivors'
   independence level, compared to the Control Group. Method: a
   quasi-experimental study conducted with 37 participants (Intervention
   Group, n=20; and Control Group, n=17). The intervention lasted 8 months.
   The outcomes of the caregivers (burden and stress) and of the survivors
   (independence level) were measured by the Zarit, Perceived Stress and
   Katz scales, at the following moments: pre-intervention, the fourth
   month of the intervention and post-intervention. The differences of
   these outcomes between groups and intra-group and the effect size were
   calculated using the Mann-Whitney and Friedman tests (Bonferroni
   adjustment by Wilcoxon) and the Kendall's W coefficient. Results: the
   Intervention Group reduced burden ( p=0.039) and stress (p=0.009),
   mainly, after 8 months of intervention, which was not observed in the
   Control Group. The independence level did not change between the groups
   or moments (p>0.05). The intervention presented moderate effect size
   (p=0.45 and p=0.54). Conclusion: the intervention was effective to
   reduce the burden and stress of family caregivers, but did not alter the
   stroke survivors' independence level, when compared to the Control
   Group.},

Abstract = {Stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability in the United
   States, affecting almost 800,000 United States citizens annually.
   Inadequate care during the transition back to home can lead to poor
   outcomes and delayed recovery. Although the transitional care period is
   often complex and multifaceted, providing patients and caregivers with
   timely, relevant education and informational resources remains an
   important foundation to any transitional care service. Utilizing
   technology to enhance post-stroke transitional care services and provide
   unlimited access to information may increase survivors' understanding
   and ability to manage their stroke recovery during the transition
   period.
   The Michigan Stroke Transitions Trial (MISTT) was a two-phased clinical
   trial study that engaged stakeholders in developing and refining two
   patient-centered post-stroke transitional care interventions intended to
   improve 90-day stroke survivor and caregiver outcomes. This case study
   describes the Patient-Centered Design approach used to develop the MISTT
   website intervention, which is a curated, patient-oriented website
   containing information and resources relevant to lived, post-stroke
   transitional care experiences.
   Lessons Learned: Substantial time, support, and funding is required for
   a multi-stage approach to creating and building a patient-centered
   website. Stakeholder engagement was crucial to the final content,
   design, and functionality of the MISTT website. Stakeholders were
   instrumental for determining how to apply best practice universal design
   guidelines to meet needs and preferences for stroke survivors and their
   caregivers.},

Abstract = {This study aims to summarize the research results on family experiences
   as caregivers in post-stroke patients' rehabilitation processes. The
   method of this study used a literature review. Google Scholar and PubMed
   were used to find Bahasa and English articles examining families as
   caregivers of stroke patients. These studies were assessed using the JBI
   critical appraisal tools for Qualitative Study with a total of 8 factors
   used to the quality of the selected articles. Nine articles were
   reviewed with JBI scores of about 90-100\%. This study found 327
   articles, and after quality assessment of these studies, nine articles
   came to review process. The review process generated six general aspects
   that have been summarized by researchers representing all emerging
   themes, namely physical, psychological, spiritual, economic, social, and
   family effort aspects. The results of this literature review hope can be
   a reference or provision related to families as caregivers.},

Abstract = {To determine the effect of cognitive behavior intervention on the life
   quality of patients with stroke and the caregiving burden of their
   caregivers. A total of 200 patients with stroke who were treated in
   Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2017 to January 2019
   were enrolled and divided into two different patient groups according to
   the nursing mode (each n = 100), and the 200 corresponding caregivers of
   the patients with stroke were selected, and assigned to an observation
   group and a control group (each n = 100). Patients in the observation
   group were given cognitive behavior intervention, while those in the
   control group were given routine nursing. The limb recovery (Fugl-Meyer
   Assessment (FMA) score and Barthel index) and neurological function
   (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and
   Scandinavian stroke scale (SSS)) of the patients were evaluated, and the
   caregiving burden score (Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) score) and
   positive feelings (positive aspects of caregiving (PAC)) of the
   caregivers were evaluated. In addition, the life quality, anxiety, and
   depression of the patients and caregivers were monitored and evaluated
   using the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), self-rating
   anxiety scale (SAS), and self-rating depression scale (SDS). Patients in
   the observation group had higher FMA scores and Barthel Index and lower
   NIHSS scores and SSS scores than the control group, and they also had
   lower caregiving burden scores and higher positive feeling scores, and
   had higher life quality scores and lower SAS and SDS scores than the
   control group. Cognitive behavior intervention has positive effect on
   patients with stroke, because it can significantly improve the life
   quality of patients and their caregivers, and lower the caregiving
   burden of the caregivers. Therefore, it is worthy of clinical promotion.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. To describe the perspective of nurses about the difficulties
   reported by Informal caregivers of older stroke survivors.
   METHOD. Qualitative and descriptive study using the focus group
   technique. Nine nurses who work In different community health units
   participated in this study. The content of earn session was recorded In
   audio to facilitate Its transcription and analysis. Data analysis was
   performed using NVIVO10 software.
   RESULTS. Seven typologies emerged by similarity: capacity to feed/drink;
   capacity to feed/hydrate through nasogastric tube; capacity to care of
   personal hygiene; capacity to use the toilet; capacity to dress/undress:
   capacity to transfer; capacity to maintain posture.
   CONCLUSIONS. Nurses should support families in the acqulsition of
   knowledge and practical skills, the resolution of daily challenges and
   problems, and in the management of resources and emotional needs of the
   person cared in order to prevent negative consequences assocated with
   care provision. An adequate health Education would allow not only to
   improve knowledge and skills in informal caregivers, but also to help
   them cope with the new situation and be able to accept the
   new-condition. Therefore, care would be more effective, improving the
   quality of life for both dependent older stroke survivors and
   caregivers.},

Title = {Figuring it out by yourself: Perceptions of home-based care of stroke
   survivors, family caregivers and community health workers in a
   low-resourced setting, South Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE \& FAMILY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Background: In less resourced settings, formal rehabilitation services
   for stroke survivors were often absent. Stroke survivors were referred
   to community health workers (CHWs) who were untrained in rehabilitation.
   Aim: To describe the experience and perceived needs of stroke survivors,
   their caregivers and CHWs in a context with limited access to and
   support from formal rehabilitation services.
   Setting: The Breede Valley subdistrict, Western Cape, South Africa, a
   rural, less resourced setting.
   Methods: A descriptive exploratory qualitative study. Four focus group
   interviews were held with purposively selected stroke survivors and
   caregivers and four with CHWs. A thematic approach and the framework
   method were used to analyse the transcripts.
   Findings: A total of 41 CHWs, 21 caregivers and 26 stroke survivors
   participated. Four main themes and 11 sub-themes were identified.
   Because of the lack of knowledge, training and rehabilitation services,
   the main theme for all groups was having to `figure things out'
   independently, with incontinence management being particularly
   challenging. Secondly was the need for emotional support for stroke
   survivors and caregivers. Thirdly, contextual factors such as
   architectural barriers and lack of assistive products negatively
   impacted care and function. Lastly, the organisation of health and
   rehabilitation services negatively impacted home-based services and
   professional support.
   Conclusions: With appropriate training, the CHWs can be pivotal in the
   training and support of family caregivers and stroke survivors. Care
   pathways and the role and scope of both CHWs and therapists in
   home-based stroke rehabilitation should be defined and restructured,
   including the links with formal services.},

Abstract = {Stroke survivors and their caregivers report not receiving enough
   information at discharge. To identify strengths and weaknesses of stroke
   discharge education, we delivered questionnaires that assessed patient
   and caregiver recall, perceived utility, and satisfaction at discharge
   as well as 1- and 3-month follow-up. Categorical data of responses were
   compared between time periods using Fischer exact test. Recall
   significantly differed between discharge (86\%) and 1-month follow-up
   (54\%, P < .05), but not discharge and 3-month follow-up (69\%). Patient
   perceived utility at both 1 month (69\%) and 3 months (64\%) was lower
   than at discharge (92\%, P < .05). Patient satisfaction was lower at 1
   month (69\%) and 3 months (54\%) than discharge (92\%, P < .05).
   Caregiver recall declined from discharge (81\%) to 1 month (65\%) but
   improved from 1 to 3 months (82\%, P < .05). Caregiver satisfaction and
   perceived utility remained positive through the study. The results
   suggest stroke patients and their caregivers suffer from education
   recall failure over time that is associated with worse satisfaction and
   perceived utility by patients. Reinforcement at 1 month may improve
   caregiver recall. We conclude that education for caregivers may be more
   reliably reinforced, suggesting a role in continued patient education.},

Abstract = {Context: Aphasia is a major disabling condition after a stroke that
   profoundly affects the quality of life of stroke survivors (SS) and
   their caregivers. Comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation has
   emerged as a complementary intervention that helps in improving the
   associated cognitive and psychological deficits and quality of life
   following a brain injury. A standardized, simple, and easy to administer
   intervention that can be delivered as a home-based intervention can
   assist in faster recovery. Aims: To describe the development,
   validation, and feasibility of a home-based, caregiver-delivered
   comprehensive neuropsychological and language rehabilitation for SS.
   Methods and Material: A culture-specific picture and task-based 8-week
   training workbook and manual were developed based on extensive review
   and focused group discussions. This intervention targeted areas of
   language (comprehension, fluency, and naming) and cognition (working
   memory, attention and concentration, executive functioning, and response
   inhibition). It was standardized on 40 healthy controls (HC) and 15 SS.
   Before recruitment, written informed consent was obtained from each
   patient, their primary caregiver, and the HCs. Results: All tasks were
   found to be effective in discriminating the performance of SS from the
   HC. The performance of the HC with respect to the errors and the time
   taken for each task was used for the hierarchical arrangement of the
   tasks. The developed intervention was later validated on 15 SS where
   they significantly improved in the pre-post assessment of language
   functioning (P < 0.001), quality of life (P < 0.001), and depression (P
   < 0.001). Conclusions: This intervention can be feasible to administer
   as a home-based intervention and may help to alleviate language and
   neuropsychological complaints after stroke in low-literate or
   mixed-cultural populations. Further, large sample size studies are
   recommended.},

Abstract = {Evidence-based models are critical for understanding caregiver
   well-being and treatment interventions from a holistic perspective. This
   study introduces the Indivisible Self: An Evidence-Based Model of
   Wellness (IS-WEL) as a means for examining the holistic wellness of
   pediatric stroke caregivers. In this exploratory study, 161 participants
   completed a demographic survey and the Five-Factor Wellness Inventory
   (FF-WEL). Results indicate significant wellness score differences
   between the current sample of pediatric stroke caregivers and the FF-WEL
   norming sample on the higher orderTotal Wellnessfactor, the second-order
   wellness factors ofCreative SelfandSocial Self, and the third-order
   wellness factors ofthinking, emotions, control, positive humor, andlove.
   These results support the veracity of the IS-WEL as an additional
   empirically sound holistic approach for understanding and addressing the
   well-being of stroke caregivers. The authors discuss practical clinical
   and research implications for utilizing the IS-WEL with pediatric stroke
   caregivers.},

Title = {The impact of availability and identity of the caregiver on the
   post-stroke patient},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERAPY AND REHABILITATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},

Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Background After having a stroke, most patients are helped by a
   caregiver with activities that they cannot perform by themselves. The
   caregiver presence and actions are an important variable that may affect
   rehabilitation in many ways. The aim of this review study was to
   evaluate the impact of caregiver presence (or absence) and identity
   (spouse, family, or foreign domestic worker) on therapeutic exercise
   performance, depression symptoms, patient-spouse relations and total
   functional outcomes of stroke patients. Assessing these effects may help
   health care professionals and families to prioritise/choose the
   caregiver for their patient/family member.
   Methods A narrative literature review was conducted, focusing on
   one-direction effects (caregiver on patient effects) on the topics of
   interest mentioned, in a post-stroke population. PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro,
   Trip database, and Google Scholar were searched, and included studies of
   most designs and research qualities. The search strategy had not been
   specified before commencing the review. Each study was analysed
   individually with the purpose of synthesising the available evidence to
   achieve a greater understanding of this topic.
   Results A total of 17 relevant papers were included: six randomised
   controlled trials, six observational studies, two systematic reviews,
   two survey-based studies, and one case series. Trials were consistent
   with the positive effect that caregivers have on therapeutic exercise
   performance. Studies have shown a positive effect of caregivers on the
   patient's depressive symptoms, but only at the chronic phase after
   stroke. A spouse caregiver seems to more positively affect the
   patient-spouse relations in the acute phase of rehabilitation, while
   foreign domestic workers can improve these relations at more chronic
   phases. The presence of a caregiver is shown to decrease functional
   outcomes within institutionalised rehabilitation centres, while it is
   necessary and positively affects functionality at more chronic phases
   within community settings.
   Conclusions The advantages and disadvantages of employing a caregiver
   depend in many cases on the rehabilitation phase. The caregiver might be
   beneficial or harmful to the patient's functional progress, depressive
   symptoms and marital relationship depending on the rehabilitation phase.
   More studies are needed to assess the caregiver effects on post-stroke
   patients' rehabilitation and quality of life.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The brutal occurrence of a stroke upsets the life of a
   parent, within his or her family and circle of friends.
   Context: The lack of medical-social interventions and support from a
   health professional for parents who have suffered a stroke forces family
   caregivers to provide care for their parents. The aim of this study is
   to describe and understand the subjective lived experience of family
   caregivers of stroke patients in such a context.
   Method: Using a clinical method and interpretative phenomenological
   analysis, eight clinical interviews were conducted at home with four
   family caregivers (two interviews per caregiver) from two separate
   families (two caregivers per family), recruited at the neurology unit in
   the internal medicine department at Yaounde military hospital.
   Results: Throughout the whole care process, family caregivers have a
   difficult experience, with painful affects and psychological fatigue.
   They are forced into subjugation by unconscious alliances through the
   quality of the bond they have with the parent who has had the stroke.
   The strengthening of this bond enables them to avoid the risk of
   psychological and relational collapse.},

Abstract = {Objective: to identify factors associated with the presence of suicidal
   ideation in caregivers of stroke survivors. Methods: cross-sectional
   survey conducted with 151 primary informal caregivers. The Depression
   Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and a questionnaire were used to evaluate
   the presence of thoughts of suicidal ideation, whose data were analyzed
   by descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: most caregivers had
   normal levels of depression (76.8\%), anxiety (76.2\%) and stress
   (79.5\%), and showed no thoughts of suicidal ideation (70.9\%). The
   correlation between scales showed that thoughts of suicidal ideation
   rise proportionally to the increase of anxiety, depression and stress
   levels. Conclusion: it was observed that high levels of depression,
   anxiety and stress favored the increased frequency of suicidal thoughts
   among caregivers of stroke survivors.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: The Portuguese instrument for informal
   caregivers' skills providing care of aged people after a stroke
   (ECPICID-AVC) evaluates the capacities that informal caregivers must
   have for supporting aged stroke survivors. The purpose was to adapt and
   validate the ECPICID-AVC to be used in Brazil. Methods: A methodological
   study was conducted. Results: The terms with the lowest degree of
   comprehension were adapted. The factor analysis suggested the exclusion
   of three items and that the remaining be grouped into six domains. The
   factor loadings varied from 0.525 to 0.924. The internal intra-assessor
   consistency was satisfactory (ICC = 0.94, CI 95\%). Total reliability
   was considered excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.914). Conclusions: The
   ECPICID-AVC is considered appropriate for using in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is a major global health problem and second leading
   cause of death worldwide. In India, the incidence of stroke rate has
   increased from 56/100,000 person to 117/100,000 person. Stroke
   rehabilitation is an active process and begins during acute
   hospitalisation. Stroke survivors may return to an active and productive
   lifestyle through rehabilitation.
   Aim: To determine the effectiveness of Structured Teaching Programme
   (STP) on the knowledge about rehabilitation of stroke patients among
   caregivers.
   Materials and Methods: A pre-experimental pre-test, post-test research
   design was used to conduct this study. Purposive sampling was the
   sampling method used to collect data from family caregivers of stroke
   survivors on the basis of semi-structured interview schedule. After
   collecting pre-test data, STP was organised for intervention of stroke
   rehabilitation to samples. Seven days were provided to the samples for
   utilising STP which was organised for 45-50 minutes through lecture,
   discussion and planned Audio-Visual (AV) aids. Post-test information was
   gathered after seven days from the day of teaching intervention. Seven
   days was assigned after getting expert opinions as well as to give time
   for implication of knowledge through practice of stroke rehabilitation.
   The sample characteristics were described by frequency, percentage and
   t-test was used to describe the difference between pre-test and
   post-test knowledge score. Chi-square test was also used to find out the
   association between knowledge of caregivers regarding stroke
   rehabilitations and selected demographic variables.
   Results: The mean pre-test knowledge score was 9.76 and mean post-test
   knowledge score was 14.7. There was a statistically significant
   improvement in the level of knowledge regarding stroke rehabilitations
   among caregivers (t(0.001.29) =3.659) and no association was found
   between pre-test knowledge level and selected demographic variables.
   Conclusion: The demand of stroke rehabilitation by involving family
   caregivers is increasing as it will help stroke patient to improve
   activity of daily livings as well as decrease disability and prevent
   complications.},

Abstract = {With stroke being one of the leading causes of disability worldwide,
   families and social systems may face strain as they adjust to a
   caregiving role. This strain may be amplified in family systems living
   in rural areas due to limited access to resources. Thus, it is important
   for helping professionals such as couple, marriage, and family
   therapists to understand what facets of this disability are linked with
   caregiver strain as well as to explore and understand various
   interventions that may ease caregiver burden. Using existing data from
   177 pairs of stroke patients and their family caregivers in rural
   Mainland China, the present study utilized a moderation analysis to
   examine (1) the association between stroke patient physical functioning,
   patient mental health, and their family caregiver burden and (2) how a
   developed patient rehabilitation intervention program for caregivers
   moderated the association between patient physical functioning as well
   as mental health and caregiver burden 6-month post intervention. Results
   suggested that better patient physical functioning were related to lower
   levels of caregiver burden (b = - 1.418, p < .001, beta = - 0.33).
   However, the developed rehabilitation intervention program did not
   significantly moderate the association between stroke patient physical
   functioning as well as mental health and caregiver burden. These
   findings provide insight into correlates of stroke patient's caregiver
   burden in rural China. Development of more effective rehabilitation
   programs and interventions for stroke patients and their family
   caregivers as well how couple, marriage, and family therapists may be
   uniquely qualified to contribute to such interventions is discussed.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe relationships between the ECPICID-AVC scale
   factors and the NANDA-I domains, classes, and Nursing Diagnoses (NDs).
   Method: Cross-mapping study between the NANDA-I taxonomy and ECPICID-AVC
   scale was constructed based on the eight ECPICID-AVC scale factors and
   the 13 NANDA-I domains. A descriptive analysis was performed to present
   the mapped elements. Results: Areas of similarity and intersection were
   found between the eight ECPICID-AVC factors and nine NANDA-I domains, 19
   classes, and 72 NDs. All scale factors were mapped with the Domain
   1/Health Promotion, Class 2/Health Management and the ND ``Frail elderly
   syndrome{''}. Final considerations:The ECPICID-AVC scale factors were
   mapped with nine domains, their classes and diagnoses. This study
   demonstrates the importance of identifying nursing diagnoses and their
   relationship with factors that evaluate caregiving capacity. The
   ECPICID-AVC can help nurses generate nursing diagnoses regarding the
   caregiver's needs and their capacities related to care to focus such
   needs.},

Abstract = {Introduction
   The aim of the study was to determine the level of knowledge about
   stroke among caregivers of patients hospitalized for stroke at the
   Cocody's university hospital (Abidjan).
   Method
   It was a cross-sectional study, carried out during a three months
   period, from 2nd April to 2nd July 2018 at the Cocody's university
   hospital.
   Through a questionnaire, we assessed knowledges, perceptions and
   behaviors of stroke patients's caregivers. We also intended to determine
   their knowledge level of risk factors and signs or symptoms of stroke.
   Results
   The study included 106 caregivers, from the entourage of stroke patients
   staying in hospital. The caregivers mean age was 40.18 +/- 13.09 years.
   The percentage of unschooled caregivers was 20.80\%. The acronym `` AVC
   `` was correctly defined by 12 caregivers (11.30\%). Half of
   participants estimated that stroke had a mystical origin, and 57.50\%
   identified `` spells `` as risk factors for stroke. Hypertension was the
   main risk factor of stroke spontaneously cited by 40.57\% of caregivers.
   The most commonly reported signs of stroke were hemiplegia and language
   impairment, reported by 78.30\% and 37.74\% of caregivers, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Our study found that knowledge of risk factors, symptoms, and ways to
   prevent stroke are inadequate.},

   for the questionnaire survey during January - June, 2016, and 575 pairs
   were eventually received. The ``Actor-Partner Interdependence{''} model
   (APIM) was constructed to study the mutual influence of two
   interdependence variables on the satisfaction with environmental
   management. Patients' age and caregivers' education level showed
   significant effects on patients' and the caregivers' satisfaction with
   environmental management (influence coefficients {[}beta=-0.10 and
   {[}3=0.08, respectively). In other words, the higher patients' age and
   the lower caregivers' education level revealed the lower satisfaction
   with environmental management. Patients' self-care degree at admission
   presented remarkably positive effects on their and the caregivers'
   satisfaction with environmental management (influence coefficients
   {[}beta=0.11 and {[}beta=0.07, respectively). In other words, the higher
   patients' self-care at admission would enhance the satisfaction with
   environmental management and caregivers' satisfaction with environmental
   management. Besides, the influence coefficient of the former was higher
   than it of the latter (beta=0.11>beta=0.07). Patients' length of stays
   merely appeared notably negative effects on the satisfaction with
   environmental management (influence coefficient {[}beta=-0.02). Both
   patients' and the caregivers' satisfaction with inpatient service showed
   significantly negative effects on the satisfaction with environmental
   management (beta=-0.33 and {[}beta=-0.16, respectively). In this case,
   the higher patients' and the caregivers' satisfaction with inpatient
   service appeared the higher satisfaction with environmental management.
   Besides, the influence coefficient of the former is higher than it of
   the latter (beta=0.33>beta=0.16). Medical staff and health decision
   makers could apply correspondent measures, enhance individual
   satisfaction with inpatient service by taking the combination of
   individual characteristics and disease characteristics of the two into
   account, and eventually promote stroke patients' satisfaction with
   environmental management.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Caregiving for stroke patients is a challenging task both
   emotionally and physically. Studies have shown that caregiving can
   affect caregivers' wellbeing that could lead to depression. Objective:
   This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and associated
   risk factors of depression amongst caregivers of stroke patients
   attending Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) in Kelantan over a 6
   month period. Methodology: This is a cross sectional study at the
   primary care clinic in HUSM over a period of 6 months. A total of 116
   caregivers of medically documented stroke patients who fulfilled the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited via convenience
   sampling. The brief patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to
   assess their depression. Descriptive statistics and bivariable analysis
   was used using SPSS version 23. Results: 63.8\% of the caregivers of
   stroke patients are depressed. Caregiver's burden, ethnicity and
   patient's ethnicity were found to be significant associated risk factors
   for depression. Conclusion: Screening for depression in caregivers
   especially those with risk factors must be carried out in the clinic in
   order to detect and intervene early. Coping mechanisms especially in the
   religious aspect should be elicited in future studies.},

Title = {ASSESSMENT OF CAREGIVER'S BURDEN AFTER STROKE AT THE BRAZZAVILLE
   UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability in adults and the
   second leading cause of dementia. After the hospitalization phase, the
   return to the patient's home is closely linked to the caregiver's
   burden. The aim of our study was to assess the burden of the primary
   caregiver of stroke patients after returning home.
   Method
   This was a longitudinal study carried out from 1st October 2014 to 30th
   September 2015 at the university hospital of Brazzaville. All patients
   hospitalized for a first stroke confirmed by brain imaging and returned
   to their homes were included. All patients with a modified Rankin Scale
   >= 2 prior to hospitalization were not included. The Zarit scale was
   used to assess the caregiver's burden. The other variables studied
   included socio-demographic data from patients and caregivers, the
   psychological and physical impact of patients' vascular hemiplegia,
   assessed respectively by abbreviated Beck's questionnaire and the
   Barthel index. The SPSS 21 software was used for statistical analysis.
   The significance threshold was set at 0.05.
   Results
   The study included 70 patients with a mean age of 55.4 +/- 11.49 years,
   with a sex ratio of 1.12. The primary caregiver was represented by a
   descendant in 44.5\%. The mean age of caregivers was 41.4 +/- 11.9
   years, significantly lower than that of the patients (p <0.001). The
   average Zarit score was 44.8 +/- 10.6; 36.4 +/- 12.1 and 27.2 +/- 13.8
   respectively at one, three and six months of follow-up. The caregiver
   burden improved over time, with an average change in the Zarit score
   between the first and the sixth month of statistically significant
   follow-up of -17.6 +/- 8.16 (p <0.001). Patient age ``over 65 years{''},
   ``spousal{''} lifestyle, and ``haemorrhagic{''} stroke were identified
   as factors associated with the caregiver's burden.
   Conclusion
   The burden of neurological disability after a stroke on the primary
   caregiver improves as the course progresses, with improved functional
   autonomy and improved patient mood. It is necessary to include this data
   in the therapeutic education of caregivers in the context of
   comprehensive care for stroke patients.},

Abstract = {Stroke literacy among family caregivers of stroke survivors is important
   to avoid stroke and manage the situation after stroke. The stroke often
   causes serious health problems; therefore, the patient's family members
   are usually those who guide his/her stroke treatment and rehabilitation
   process, do homecare and prevent stroke recurrence. Accordingly,
   qualitative and clear information as well as skills in obtaining,
   evaluating and using it are important competences for caregivers. The
   aim of this study is to better understand stroke literacy among family
   caregivers of stroke survivors in Latvia, with a focus on information
   sources family caregivers used, on issues family caregivers feel the
   most / least informed about. The research object is stroke survivors'
   family caregivers. Two methods - survey and qualitative content analysis
   - were applied in this study. Total of 51 caregiver in the survey
   completed a self-administered questionnaire, and 100 articles in the
   Internet have been analysed. The study results show that the Internet is
   an important source to obtain information about stroke and caregivers
   who search information on the Internet feel less informed about several
   stroke related issues. Study results also indicate many cases when
   caregivers had not obtained or had not understood the information
   provided by doctors, as well as show the limited amount of useful
   information about stroke treatment, rehabilitation, and support.},

Abstract = {Aim: This paper presents the pilot project ``The Caregivers' Guide{''},
   which is financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and
   Research (BMBF). The project's concept is outreach-oriented and
   personal, giving constant support to relatives of stroke patients
   throughout rehabilitation. Its effects were reviewed in an accompanying
   study.
   Method: A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was chosen
   to gather data on the experiences and assessments of the caregivers, as
   well as changes during the counselling process. 62 caregivers completed
   questionnaires before and after the intervention. Additionally, 30
   qualitative interviews were carried out.
   Results: Positive effects could be observed in accordance with the
   project goals, especially regarding provision of appropriate
   information, burden reduction and strengthening clients' resources. The
   accompaniment by a fixed reference person was viewed as helpful, the
   combination of professional knowledge and emotional support was deemed
   most essential.
   Discussion: The concept ``The Caregivers' Guide{''} is suitable as an
   impetus of innovation regarding the development of counseling structures
   for family caregivers.},

Abstract = {Aim: The purpose of this phenomenological study is to contribute to the
   literature surrounding caregivers of persons with stroke and to
   understand the caregivers' perspective on leisure participation and
   quality of life. Methods' Caregivers (n = 4) of clients with stroke were
   recruited for they study via convenience sampling. Participants were
   audio-recorded during a semi-structured interview lasting 60-80 minutes.
   The interview guide included open-ended questions about the
   participant's leisure participation and quality of life. Recorded data
   was transcribed and in-vivo coding was completed. Results: Eight
   categories were developed from the identified codes and narrowed into
   primary themes: role shift, loss of control, and occupational
   deprivation, consistent with Moustakas (1994) as adapted by Creswell
   (2013). Conclusions: Understanding the essence of the lived experience
   of caregivers is important to the occupational therapy profession
   because of the prevalence of caregiver burden and the impact such
   roleransition has on their occupational participation and that of the
   client.},

Journal = {INTERNET JOURNAL OF ALLIED HEALTH SCIENCES AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the occupational
   needs of caregivers of stroke survivors and to identify potential
   implications for occupational therapy's role with this population.
   Methods: Focus groups and a semi-structured interview were used to
   gather an in-depth perspective on caregivers' needs and level of
   participation in valued activities. Interactions were recorded and
   transcribed verbatim. Data analysis included open coding, formulation of
   categorical patterns, and thematic analysis. Rigor was enhanced through
   peer review, multiple coders, member checking, and triangulation.
   Results: Four primary themes emerged: (1) the essential need for
   additional services and support; (2) the amount of time spent on
   addressing spouses' needs resulted in occupational loss; (3) finding new
   ways to participate in daily life activities; and, (4) an association
   between the survivor's level of impairment and the caregiver's quality
   of life. Conclusion: Demands of caregiving can lead to changes in roles,
   responsibilities, and routines. Occupational therapy practitioners are
   uniquely qualified to reinstate valued occupations into daily life,
   formulate balanced routines, and provide client specific supports and
   resources. Occupational therapy services could provide strategies to
   enhance caregivers' ability to partake in meaningful occupations and
   resume a balanced lifestyle. More research is needed to determine the
   occupational needs of caregivers and the effectiveness of caregiver
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Objective: To quantify the availability of informal caregivers in
   surviving stroke patients residing at home in Belgium.
   Methods: National estimates on the availability of informal caregivers
   were made using data from a nationwide observational registration of
   family physicians working in sentinel practices and a nationwide
   administrative database for reimbursement of hospitals in Belgium.
   Results: A total of 189 Belgian family physicians (FPs) from 141
   practices participated in the study and recorded 326 patients (144 men
   and 182 women) with stroke. These FPs reach 1.5\% of the Belgian
   population. After 1 month, 71\% of the male and 75\% of the female
   stroke survivors received support from family caregivers (p = 0.547).
   After 6 months, the percentage of male patients who received support
   from family caregivers decreased to 60\% compared with 75\% in female (p
   = 0.038). Of all patients with stroke admitted to Belgian hospitals
   during the reference year 2009 (n = 16.437), 8.997 returned home. Based
   on the findings from the sentinel practices, it is estimated that a mean
   of 73\% (n = 6.568) and 67.5\% (n = 6.073) of surviving patients with
   stroke can rely on informal caregivers in their home setting after one
   and 6 months, respectively.
   Conclusions: A vast majority of surviving stroke patients in Belgium can
   rely on informal caregivers in their home setting, but their
   availability rapidly decreases 6 months after the event. These findings
   underline the importance of proactive health policy making in stroke
   care taking into account the potentially decreasing number of available
   informal caregivers in the decades to come.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the psychological burden of caregivers of
   patients with stroke. METHOD Cross-sectional study of 106 caregivers of
   patients who had suffered a stroke at least one month before the survey.
   The data were collected from the caregivers of patients hospitalized in
   3 public hospitals in Attica, using a questionnaire that included
   questions about the clinical characteristics of the patients and the
   demographic characteristics of the caregivers, who also completed scales
   measuring psychological burden, sense of coherence-cohesion, positive
   meaning (benefit finding) and anxiety and depression. RESULTS Twenty of
   the caregivers were males (18.9\%) and 86 females (81.1\%). Caregiver
   anxiety and depression were found to be positively related to all
   dimensions of caregiver burden (disappointment, general strain,
   isolation, environment, emotional involvement). A high sense of
   coherence (meaningfulness, manageability, comprehensibility) was
   significantly negatively correlated with depressive symptoms in the
   caregivers. The age of the caregiver was positively associated with
   benefit finding (acceptance). Higher levels of overall caregiver burden,
   older age of the caregiver, greater emotional attachment to the patient,
   and lower levels of comprehensibility were related to a higher degree of
   depressive symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS Taking care of patients with
   stroke is associated with a heavy psychological burden and psychological
   morbidity in the caregivers, in the form of depressive symptoms. Issues
   of family members taking care of a close relative suffering from stroke
   are raised by these findings.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Studies suggest that family caregiver well-being
   (ie, depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) may affect stroke
   survivor depressive symptoms. We used mediation analysis to assess
   whether caregiver well-being might be a factor explaining stroke
   survivor depressive symptoms, after controlling for demographic factors
   and stroke survivor impairments and problems. Methods: Caregiver/stroke
   participant dyads (N = 146) completed measures of stroke survivor
   impairments and problems and depressive symptoms and caregiver
   depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Mediation analysis was used
   to examine whether caregiver well-being mediated the relationship
   between stroke survivor impairments and problems and stroke survivor
   depressive symptoms. Results: As expected, more stroke survivor problems
   and impairments were associated with higher levels of stroke survivor
   depressive symptoms (P < .0001). After controlling for demographic
   factors, we found that this relationship was partially mediated by
   caregiver life satisfaction (29.29\%) and caregiver depressive symptoms
   (32.95\%). Although these measures combined to account for 40.50\% of
   the relationship between survivor problems and impairments and
   depressive symptoms, the direct effect remained significant.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that stroke survivor impairments and
   problems may affect family caregivers and stroke survivors and a high
   level of caregiver distress may result in poorer outcomes for stroke
   survivors. Results highlight the likely importance of intervening with
   both stroke survivors and family caregivers to optimize recovery after
   stroke.},

Abstract = {Recovery after stroke is often incomplete and many stroke survivors
   depend on family caregivers. The demands of caring can negatively impact
   quality of life of these carers. This study explores levels of strain
   experienced by caregivers and the variables that impact on their strain.
   A concurrent, mixed method, descriptive design was utilized. Fifty-seven
   caregivers of stroke survivors who received rehabilitation at the
   Western Cape Rehabilitation Centre participated in the study. The
   Barthel Index and Caregiver Strain Index were utilised to collect
   quantitative data, which was statistically analysed (p < 0.05).
   Qualitative data was collected through semistructured interviews and
   thematically analysed.
   Fifty eight percent of caregivers were experiencing high levels of
   strain. The following variables significantly impacted on strain namely,
   caregiver loss of employment (0.04), emotional pressure (0.01), patient
   residual cognitive and perceptual impairments (0.01), personality
   changes (0.01) and physical dependency (0.0012). According to the
   qualitative data the burden was aggravated by financial problems,
   patient perceptual problems and patient personality changes. The
   findings indicate the need for support after discharge, ongoing
   community support and respite care to enable time off for caregivers.},

Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOTHERAPY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {4-8},
Abstract = {Recovery after stroke is often incomplete and many stroke survivors
   depend on family caregivers. The demands of caring can negatively impact
   quality of life of these carers. This study explores levels of strain
   experienced by caregivers and the variables that impact on their strain.
   A concurrent, mixed method, descriptive design was utilized. Fifty-seven
   caregivers of stroke survivors who received rehabilitation at the
   Western Cape Rehabilitation Centre participated in the study. The
   Barthel Index and Caregiver Strain Index were utilised to collect
   quantitative data, which was statistically analysed (p < 0.05).
   Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews and
   thematically analysed.
   Fifty eight percent of caregivers were experiencing high levels of
   strain. The following variables significantly impacted on strain namely,
   caregiver loss of employment (0.04), emotional pressure (0.01), patient
   residual cognitive and perceptual impairments (0.01), personality
   changes (0.01) and physical dependency (0.0012). According to the
   qualitative data the burden was aggravated by financial problems,
   patient perceptual problems and patient personality changes. The
   findings indicate the need for support after discharge, ongoing
   community support and respite care to enable time off for caregivers.},

Abstract = {Stroke rehabilitation, especially for patients with sequelae, lacks
   practicable rehabilitation training methods. Using the convenience
   sampling method, self-care ability in 60 stroke patients was
   investigated for 6 months to 2 years post-stroke (sequelae stage), as
   well as the capability of primary caregivers selected from two
   communities in Shanghai, China. Influential factors were analyzed.
   Results demonstrated that only 37\% of stroke patients exhibited strong
   self-care ability, and 43\% of primary caregivers provided high levels
   of care. Results also demonstrated that self-care ability in stroke
   patients, as well as the capability of primary caregivers, should be
   improved. A total of 47\% of stroke patients participated in community
   rehabilitation training, and self-care ability was significantly better
   in this group than in patients who did not receive rehabilitation
   training. Thus it is necessary to develop systematic, individualized,
   and family-based rehabilitative strategies to improve community
   rehabilitation training modes and strengthen rehabilitation guidance for
   patients and caregivers.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess the impact of active training ({''}handson
   training{''}) caregivers on their attitudes for handling the patients
   and to examine the effectiveness of hands-on training in improving
   psychosocial outcomes for stroke patients and their caregivers.
   Method: The subjects were 59 stroke patients and their family
   caregivers. They were randomly divided into two groups: a control group
   and a training group. The training group received active hands-on
   training about personal care with handling techniques. We collected the
   data through interviewing the patients and their caregivers on admission
   and at discharge. The stroke patients and caregivers were evaluated with
   the functional status, caregiver appraisal scale, psychological state,
   quality of life.
   Results: Caregivers in the training group experienced a significant
   reduction in caregiving burden and anxiety (p < 0.05). There were no
   differences in depression or physical health between the two groups,
   although caregivers in the intervention group were found to have
   significantly better mental health. Patients in the caregiver training
   group also experienced less anxiety and better mental health (p < 0.05),
   and had a modest benefit in functional status (independence in
   activities of daily living) (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: A hands-on training for caregivers of post-stroke inpatients
   resulted in reducing burden of care and anxiety while improving
   psychosocial outcomes for caregivers, proving that the hands-on training
   might be helpful in caregivers of stroke inpatients.},

Abstract = {Assessing post stroke depression (PSD) for those with cognitive and
   communication problems can be difficult and often leave their depression
   unnoticed and untreated. The purpose of the study was to identify
   factors that are related to PSD in spit of the post stroke impairment.
   A total of 79 stroke survivors and 74 caregivers were assessed.
   Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores along with patients' personal
   background and functioning score on Barthal Index (BI) were analyzed.
   Results showed that PSD was best predicted by BI and patients' age when
   stroke occurred. High correlation coefficient of PSD rating was found
   between the stroke survivors and their caregivers. It is concluded that
   the involvement of the caregivers can be valuable in detecting
   caretakers' depression following stroke.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the problematic aspects of the
   families of people who were hospitalized because of strokes, and discuss
   the difficulties of the family caregiver toward household care. The
   sample consisted of 154 families of patients admitted in a public
   hospital in Fortaleza, Ceara state, Brazil. The results showed that most
   caregivers are women, 104 (67.5\%); 122 cases (79.2\%) showed family
   commitment and changes in the daily life of 115 accompanying partners
   (74.7\%); 150 (97.4\%) were not instructed about the care, but 143
   (92.9\%) felt safe to provide care. The predominant feeling was sadness,
   in 125 (81.2\%) of the subjects, and the main doubts were: eating
   habits, 64 (41.6\%); administering medication, 49 (29.9\%); and possible
   clinical complications after discharge, 49 (29.9\%). These results are
   worth noting for the nurse's role as an educator, not only regarding the
   prevention of chronic-degenerative diseases, but also concerning
   delivering instructions to family caregivers about providing care after
   hospital discharge.},

Abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of people in developing countries who
   suffer strokes, the long-term care of people who have had a stroke and
   who are living with disabilities has substantial consequences for
   caregivers and their respective families. As the caregiver plays a
   pivotal role in the rehabilitation of the people who have had a stroke,
   the objectives of this study constitute an investigation into the
   complexities of caregiving, including both perceptions and experiences
   of the healthcare system. Semi-structured interviews were utilised to
   elicit post-stroke experiences of six caregivers. The challenge the
   South African context adds to these experiences was probed. The data
   were analysed qualitatively by thematic and content analysis. Prominent
   themes associated with caregiving included: role changes and
   relationship disruptions within the family, occupational and social
   implications, fatigue, anxiety, depression, loneliness, frustration as
   well as financial problems. Caregiver experiences were exacerbated by
   the inadequate support structures available. The results are interpreted
   within a biopsychosocial approach, concluding with the concerns raised
   by caregivers on the support they require from the healthcare system in
   order to provide home-based care.},

Abstract = {Trends related to rapidly aging populations nationally and
   internationally, combined with shortages in skilled health professionals
   and rising health care costs have necessitated efficient and
   cost-effective technologies for improved access to health care services.
   This paper discusses the use of low-bandwidth telephonic technology for
   providing nursing and counseling services to stroke caregivers in urban
   and rural areas and addresses factors that affect adoption and
   utilization of technologies for their intended use. Twenty-one subjects
   with recent stroke and their caregivers and five nurses were enrolled in
   the study. Seventy-two telehealth visits (i.e. tele-visits) were made to
   urban and rural locations using standard plain-old-telephone-service
   (POTS). Eighty-three percent of televists experienced first-time
   completion success at a bandwidth of 27.6+/-3 kbps. Over one-third
   (36\%) of visits were unsolicited and initiated by caregivers using the
   protocol. Each tele-visit lasted approximately 20 minutes. Televisit
   sessions ranged from providing health care instruction for caregivers to
   stroke-related education to caregiver counseling. Televists were widely
   accepted by stroke subjects and caregivers. Acceptance and utilization
   of telehealth services correlated with rapport between at-home users and
   nurses.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of the
   domiciliary terminal care of stroke patients compared to other diseases.
   We analyzed data from home-visit nursing care stations in Japan
   concerning 1234 elderly patients (mean age 82.7). The patients were
   divided into stroke, cancer and others. Stroke patients experienced a
   longer duration of home-visit care, more dependent status, and more
   difficulties with prognosis prediction than cancer patients. However,
   the site of death (home/hospital) did not show significant differences
   between diseases. Both means of the estimated physician's attitude
   towards domiciliary terminal care (3.3 vs. 3.6) and caregiver's
   satisfaction (3.6 vs. 4.0) of stroke patients, which were estimated by
   nurses using a global 5-point score, were significantly lower than those
   of cancer patients. Results suggest that prognosis prediction and
   physician's attitude are crucial for higher caregiver's satisfaction.},
